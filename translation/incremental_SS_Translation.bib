Likewise, scant attention has been paid to the few illustrated copies of the Persian version known today. By good fortune, a portion of one such rare Kitab-i Hashayish--probably datable to the seventeenth century and with its folios totally out of textual order--belongs to the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies (LJS 278). This presentation introduces the manuscript's codicology, production, iconography, and painting styles, as well as the methodology employed in an effort to reconstruct its original textual sequence. Also under consideration here is the uncertain attribution of LJS 278, a problem directly related to its provenance.},

  volume       = {4},
  abstract     = {Conclusions
The DHAR-1 paleoclimate record indicates that the 4.2 ka event
consisted of three distinct dry phases that involved a decrease in
both the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and Indian Winter
Monsoon (IWM). Prior studies have focused exclusively on either
ISM or winter rainfall depending on their location, so additional
multi-proxy studies from the overlapping region (particularly the
western region, covering 5.0–3.0 ka BP) are critically needed to
better understand the interaction of these two rainfall systems.
The impact of the 4.2 ka event is especially detectable in north-
west South Asia because the ISM and IWM domains overlap in
this region, and both seasons were affected by decreased rainfall
during the mid-late Holocene transition. The role of winter
aridity is particularly noteworthy as it enhances and prolongs the
driest growing season. The DHAR-1 record shows a 230-year
period from 4.2 to 3.97 ka BP where all moisture proxies (ISM,
PAP, and drip rate) unambiguously indicate aridity, punctuated
by three 25–90 year-long phases of lower rainfall that lasted long
enough to affect multiple generations of individual populations
and their subsistence strategies. After 3.97 ka BP, diverging trends
in these proxies suggest yearlong aridity was replaced by more
complex shifts in rainfall seasonality and environmental condi-
tions—including a recovery of the ISM by 3.7 ka BP alongside
drier and/or cooler winters that may have also promoted a long-
term ecological shift towards more drought-resistant grassy
vegetation. Eventually, this may have increased waterlogging of
soil above the cave to the point of altering local redox conditions.
Shifting seasonality of precipitation appears to be a key factor
influencing the populations in the Indus River Basin over the
mid-late Holocene, encouraging cropping adaptations and shift-
ing population centers based on the availability of food and water
throughout the year.},

  volume       = {65},
  abstract     = {This study proposes a new understanding of the semantics behind Sanskrit śigru-, which Lubotsky (2002) suggested is a loanword from Scythian related to Old Persian *θigra(ka)- and Modern Persian sīr “garlic.” Although śigru- has been assumed to refer to Moringa oleifera Lam. “drumstick tree,” Meulenbeld (2009=2018) has shown that in Āyurvedic literature it is not exclusively used to denote moringa, but must have referred to various pungent, pro-pitta plants. Lubotsky proposed that what links śigru- (as moringa) to Iranian words for garlic is the idea of a sharp shape. However, given Meulenbeld’s conclusions, enhanced by the survey of śigru- in non-Āyurvedic literature undertaken here, the author proposes that the connection is sharp taste rather than shape. The pungent connection is supported by the fact that Dharma texts forbid eating śigru- along with garlic and onions, as well as by semantic developments of the Sanskrit root tij-.

Prompted by the sensory insights of a contemporary Ayurvedic physician who simulated “hydro-dissection” on a human hand, I offer a sensory reading of representations of surgeons and surgical tactility in early South Asia. This study demonstrates that surgeons are represented in early first-millennium treatises as possessing specialized medical knowledge, performing dangerous procedures, and having greater sensory and bodily intimacy in their engagement with patients than general physicians. First, I compare passages describing physicians’ sensory engagements in diagnostic examination in the Carakasaṃhitā and Suśrutasaṃhitā. Then I examine representations of surgeons and surgical practice in the Carakasaṃhitā, a general medical compendium. Finally, I demonstrate that surgical tactility is represented in the Suśrutasaṃhitā as an interplay of sensory knowledge, technical skill, experience, and judgment, constituting the surgeon’s hand.},

This paper aims to present two small but much needed correctives to this understanding. In the first section I argue that the “Greek” astronomy that was translated into Arabic ought more correctly to be described as Greco-Babylonian astronomy. In the second I turn to India: not only was a great deal of Indian knowledge absorbed at the time of the great translation movement, we must recall that the exchanges with India carried on well beyond the early Abbasids. I illustrate these points with some new materials in the fields of medicine, philosophy, and alchemy.},

  abstract         = {The ancient ritual drink used in religious ceremonies and known as soma in India and ashaoma in the Zoroastrian tradition is praised in the highest terms—as a kind of deity—in both Zoroastrian and Vedic texts, which date from around 1,700–1,500 BCE. It is said to provide health, power, wisdom and even immortality. Many theories have been published about the possible botanical identity of this ‘nectar of immortality’, a plant which appears to have psychedelic/entheogenic properties.

Matthew Clark spent several years researching and travelling widely in his quest of soma. In his fascinating, original and highly readable book, this modern explorer of ancient wisdom reviews scholarly research, explores mythology and ritual and shares his extensive knowledge of psychoactive plants and fungi. The author suggests that the visionary soma drink was based on analogues of ayahuasca, using a variety of plants, some of which can now be identified.

Author: Dr. Matthew Clark is a Research Associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies (University of London), where he has taught courses on Hinduism. He has spent many years in India, which he first visited in 1977. He first engaged with yoga in the mid-1970s and lectures regularly on yoga and philosophy. His publications include The Daśanāmī-Saṃnyāsīs: The Integration of Ascetic Lineages into an Order (2006), which is a study of a sect of sādhus, and a short book on the origins and practices of yoga (2007). He is also a song-writer and musician (Mahabongo).},

Viewed against this background the paucity of studies on theoretical concepts is astonishing. By far the larger majority of writings on Indian medicine, in particular those by Indian authors, are concerned with practice and its justification, not with its theoretical basis. Studies on philosophical concepts that form an integral part of medical thought form an exception. This state of the art, though regrettable, is easily understandable. The theory of {\=a}yurveda is intricate, the differences of opinion on all kinds of topics are numerous and the basic concepts together with the ways in which they are interconnected are far from transparent.},

The first part is devoted to the examination of the oldest Nepalese manuscripts whose date can be determined with different degrees of certitude (among others, a manuscript of the Su{\'s}rutasa{\d m}hit{\=a} dated 13th April, 878, and a manuscript of the Skandapur{\=a}na, dated 10th March, 811).

on a rich and varied documentation, gathered from treatises which are not always easily available.
In his opus magnum, A History of Indian Medical Literature, G. Jan Meulenbeld shows that a lot
of work has still to be done in this field. This article provides a small summary of data collected in
the most famous classical treatises on the specific question of miscarriage. First, I will recall the
ideas commonly shared on “normal” conception and pregnancy, in order to highlight the etiology
of garbhavyāpad; then, some diseases will be analysed in more detail to illustrate three issues: 1°)
the clever synthesis of earlier sources (CS and SS) realized by Vāgbhaṭa; 2 °) the original position
of the Suśrutasaṃhitā; 3 °) the ambiguity of certain terms in the āyurvedic tradition.},

Although these envenomations (also known as envenomings) are rarely fatal, about 70 percent require antivenom therapy. Few evidence-based guidelines are available for the management of envenomation. Antivenom therapy is the cornerstone of management for hemorrhagic or coagulopathic envenomation from pit vipers (with or without paralytic features), and for paralytic envenomation from coral snakes. Early intubation and ventilation may be required after bites from pit vipers whose venoms contain presynaptic neurotoxins. Although relatively controversial, antivenom therapy seems to be effective for the management of severe envenomation from widow spiders. Conversely, little evidence supports any specific management strategy for necrotic envenomation from recluse spiders. Cytotoxic fish stings, cnidarian stings, and traumatic penetrative envenomation by stingrays are typically managed symptomatically. Private collection of nonnative venomous animals in the United States is another source of medical risk.},

  abstract  = {The research into the dietary habits of a country and its people is a large part of the anthropologist's work. Some of them have specialised themselves in interpreting the dietary taboos and restrictions written in the old scriptures. It has been recognized for a long time that dietary habits are at the basis of social structures and relationships and that the studying of these habits is an important element of understanding a culture. The classic Indian 'Dharma' literature gives much attention to food: what animals and plants can or cannot be eaten, from which people are you allowed to receive food, and what terms decide whether or not a foodtype is or isn't qualified for consumption. In this book Olivelle speaks about two subjects. First he takes a closer look at two terms central to the discussion about dietary rules: the Sanscrit words 'abhaksya' and 'abhojya' which translate to forbidden (abhaksya) and unsuitable (abhojya). Then he takes a closer look at the list concerning these two types of prescribed food which can be found in several classical books on law in India. Finally Olivelle reviews the types of key elements found in the dietary rules of Ancient India.},

Chinese historical records, popular literature and medical works and compilations indicate that it was closely related to Indian medicine. The origins of this transmission can be traced to early Chinese Buddhist canonical literature. Chinese and Indian ophthalmological works of the time are studied here, especially ophthalmic diseases like pterygium, entropion or trichiasis and cataract, which often call for surgical intervention as a way of giving curative or palliative treatment. The texts reflect upon the origin, route and nature of this transmission, and vividly depict the gradual introduction of various aspects of surgery into Chinese medicine. Indian medicine was thus a prominent contributor to the development of Chinese medicine and, especially, surgery from the seventh century A.D. onwards.},

  abstract         = {http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/7*.html (consulted 12/1/2012) from Liber 7: 13 [Legamen ad versionem Latinam]I have already made mention elsewhere61 of p347cataract, because when of recent origin it is also often dispersed by medicaments: when it is more chronic it requires treatment by surgery, and this is one of the most delicate operations. Before I speak of this, the nature of the eyeball itself has to be briefly explained. A knowledge of this is often useful, but especially here. The eyeball, then, has two external tunics, of which the outer is called by the Greeks ceratoides.62 In that part of the eye which is white it is fairly thick; over the region of the pupil it is thin. bTo this tunic the under one is joined; in the middle where the pupil is, it is pierced by a small hole: around this it is thin, further out it too is thicker and is called by the Greeks chorioides.63 These two tunics whilst enclosing the contents of the eyeball, coalesce again behind it, and after becoming thinned out and fused into one, go through the space between the bones, and adhere to the membrane of the brain. Under these two tunics, at the spot where the pupil is, there is an empty space; then underneath again is the thinnest tunic, which Herophilus named arachnoides.64 cAt its middle the arachnoides is cupped, and contained in that hollow is what, from its resemblance to glass, the Greeks call hyaloides;65 it is humour, neither fluid nor thick, but as it were curdled, and upon its colour is dependent the colour of the pupil, whether black or steel-blue, since the outer tunic is quite white: but this humour is enclosed by that thin p349membrane which comes over it from the interior. In front of these is a drop of humour like white of egg, from which comes the faculty of seeing; it is named by the Greeks crystalloides.66 14 [Legamen ad versionem Latinam]Now either from disease or from a blow, a humour forms underneath the two tunics in what I have stated to be an empty space;67 and this as it gradually hardens is an obstacle to the visual power within. And there are several species of this lesion; some curable, some which do not admit of treatment. For there is hope if the cataract is small, and immobile, if it has also the colour of sea water or of glistening steel, and if at the side there persists some sensation to a flash of light. If large, if the black part of the eye has lost its natural configuration and is changed to another form, if the colour of the suffusion is sky blue or golden, if it shakes and moves this way and that, then it is scarcely ever to be remedied. bGenerally too the case is worse when the cataract has arisen from a severe disease, from severe pains68 in the head or from a blow of a violent kind. Old age is not favourable for treatment, since apart from this lesion, sharpness of vision is naturally dulled; neither is childhood favourable, but rather intermediate ages. Neither a small nor a sunken eye is satisfactory for treatment. And in the cataract itself, there is a certain development. Therefore we must wait until it is no longer fluid, but appears to have coalesced to some sort of hardness. Before p351treatment the patient should eat in moderation and for three days beforehand drink water, for the day before abstain from everything. cThen he is to be seated opposite the surgeon in a light room, facing the light, while the surgeon sits on a slightly higher seat; the assistant from behind holds the head so that the patient does not move: for vision can be destroyed permanently by a slight movement. In order also that the eye to be treated may be held more still, wool is put over the opposite eye and bandaged on: further the left eye should be operated on with the right hand, and the right eye with the left hand. dThereupon a needle is to be taken pointed enough to penetrate, yet not too fine; and this is to be inserted straight through the two outer tunics at a point intermediate between the pupil of the eye and the angle adjacent to the temple, away from the middle of the cataract, in such a way that no vein is wounded.69 The needle should not be, however, entered timidly, for it passes into the empty space; and when this is reached even a man of moderate experience cannot be mistaken, for there is then no resistance to pressure. eWhen the spot is reached, the needle is to be sloped against the suffusion itself and should gently rotate there and little by little guide it below the region of the pupil; when the cataract has passed below the pupil it is pressed upon most firmly in order that it may settle below.70 If it sticks there the cure is accomplished; if it returns to some extent, it is to be cut up with the same needle and separated into several pieces, which can be the more easily stowed away singly, and form smaller obstacles to vision. fAfter this the p353needle is drawn straight out; and soft wool soaked in white of egg is to be put on, and above this something to check inflammation; and then bandages. Subsequently the patient must have rest, abstinence, and inunction with soothing medicaments; the day following will be soon enough for food, which at first should be liquid to avoid the use of the jaws; then, when the inflammation is over, such as has been prescribed for wounds,71 and in addition to these directions it is necessary that water should for some time be the only drink.},

P. 138: "We must rather recognise that we are still dealing with an epoch before the systematic study of medicine and with theologians who were by no means troubled by facts in their identifications. Dr. Hoernle has, we think, laid too much stress on the passages cited from the {\'S}atapatha Br{\=a}hma{\d n}a."

Keith also undoes Hoernle's dating of the Yaj{\~n}avalkya sm{\d r}ti because he cites books of Y. that are late and attributed to {\'S}{\=a}{\d n}{\d d}ilya not Y. And therefore, too, since these texts are from the west ({\'S}{\=a}{\d n}{\d d}ilya) not the east (Yaj{\~n}avalkya) and they cannot be evidence that they borrowed from Su{\'s}ruta who was from the east.

p. 139: "There are many other points of great interest in Dr. Hoernles book. Unfortunately the doubtfulness of the chronology renders impossible any useful comparison with Greek Medicine. So far as it goes the evidence tells conclusively against Greek borrowing from India, and the possibility of Indian borrowing from thence cannot be refuted until some satisfactory evidence can be adduced allowing us to assign Caraka and Su{\'s}ruta to an earlier date than the beginning of the Christian era. Nor can it be denied that the history of Indian Astronomy tells in favour of Indian borrowing from Greece. The Greek princes of Bactria no doubt brought with them physicians trained in the Alexandrian schools in which as early as the first half of the third century B. C. an extensive system of dissection of the human body prevailed (p.IV)."},

  cut the skin of the forehead above the eyebrows and made it fall down over 
  the wounds on the nose. Then, giving it a twist so that the live flesh might 
  meet the other live surface, by healing applications they fashioned for them 
  other imperfect noses. There is left above, between the eyebrows, a small 
  hole, caused by the twist given to the skin to bring the two live surfaces 
  together. In a short time the wounds heal up, some obstacle being placed 
  beneath to allow of respiration. I saw many persons with such noses, and they 
  were not so disfigured as they would have been without any nose at all, but 
  they bore between their eyebrows the mark of the incision. \end{quote*} Cf.\

These depend chiefly upon the Amrit Sagar, an abridgement of Susruta, Charaka and other well-known Sanskrit authors which was drawn up in 1779--1803 by order of Maharaja Partap Singh, one of the Chiefs of Jeypore. \citep[IIa.341--2]{meul-hist} 3. Hakims or Mohamedan physicians, who practised the Yun{\=a}ni or Greek (more correctly Arabian or humoral) system of medicine. Very few of them were educated. One or two of these are still attached to each of the State regiments. 4. Jarrahs or barber-surgeons, a very poor and ignorant set of men, who bled, drew teeth, applied the actual cautery, and bandaged limbs in cases of fracture. They have great influence still, especially with the women. 5. Sathyas or couchers, who practised reclination of the crystalline lens in case of cataract. 6. Bairagis or Hindu, and fakirs or Musulman, devotees; wise women; clever persons who drive out diseases by the aid of the jharu or broom and charms. 7. Pansaries or Druggists, at whose shops Baids are accustomed to sit and practice. There are no regulations for the sale of poisons, hence there are great risks of accidents occurring. Something ought to be done in this matter. Besides all these the people resorted to temples, make pilgrimages and listened to any one (especially to the priests) who had a word to say on the subject of their diseases, and adopted the advice of any plausible individual. At the present moment it is the fashion for Hindu mothers to take their children to an old fakir who has set up a hut tow or three miles from the town. Some time ago a sweeper used to sit outside the jail gates and pretend to drive out diseases with his broom. Hindus mix up religion so much with every action, particularly where eating and drinking are concerned, that they fear to use strange, and especially European, drugs, which {5}, they think, contaminate them. Of course the greatest care is taken in our hospitals to meet this difficulty, but no doubt it is a cause for the fewer attendance of people of this class than of Mohamedans.},

Asked to tell her story, she said, as well as she could through her cut and swollen lips, that when her husband had dies, his brother had claimed her in order to get his estate; but as she was unwilling to marry him, he cut off her nose, and slit her lips, and cast her forth. She had gone straight to Bann{\'u}, and Zabita Khan had performed a very neat operation, having supplied what was wanted from her cheeks instead of her forehead, as was usual. Two quills did duty for the time as nostrils. This old Malik has always three or four patients on hand. On one occasion I saw five at his house, three women and two men. The former had lost their noses for unfaithfulness; the latter for attempting intrigues with other men's wives." Kindly sent by Mike Miles},

  annotation       = {[p.39 ff.:] On undertaking the first of the two cases to be hereafter narrated, I was induced to make such personal inquiries as were within my reach in this country, concerning the {Indian} method. I did myself the honour to write to Sir Charles Mallet, who had resided many years in {India}, and who obligingly onfirmed to me that the report, that this had been a common operation in {India}, from time immemorial; adding, that it had always been performed by the caste of brickmakers, and, that though not invariably, it was usually successful. Mr. James Stuart Hall, a gentleman who was many years in {India}, assured me, that he had seen the operation performed, and that it was of tedious length. From Dr. Barry, of the India service, I learned that he also had seen the operation; that it occupied an hour and a half, and was perfomed with an old razor, the edge of which, being continually blunted in dissection, was every moment re-set. Tow was introduced to support the nose, but no attempt to form nostrils, by adding a septum, was made. I am obligingly informed by Major Heitland, of the India service, that in {India}, several years ago, in the time of Hyder Ali, Mr. Lucas, an English surgeon, was, in several instances, successful in the operation, which he copied from the Hindoo practitioners. Boyer mentions, that the late M. Chopart once employed, in a manner, as it seems, similar to the Indian, a portion of the integuments of the neck, to fill up a void space, left by the operation for a cancerous lip\ldots . [p.100, appendix II:] Since the preceeding sheets have passed the press, some additional facts, regarding the {Indian} operation, and particularly the case of Cowasjee, have come to my knowledge. Lieutenant-Colonel Ward, of the India service, but at this time resident in London, was the commanding officer of Cowasjee, at the time when the latter was mutilated by the order of Tippoo Sultan, and also witnessed the operation performed for restoring the nose. This gentleman has done me the honour to communicate the following particulars. Cowasjee and four other native soldiers, were made prisoners by the marauding party of Tippoo Sultan. The enemy cut off the hands and noses of all the five, and then sent them back to the English, with leaves bound over the stumps oftheir arms, to stop the bleeding, but with the remains of their noses as they were left by the knife. In this deplorable state, they entered Poonah. The wounds were healed, and pensions granted to the unhappy sufferers. Some time had elapsed, when, one day, at Poonah, a native merchant came to the house of Sir Charles Warre Malet, the British resident at that city, offering for sale oil-cloth, and stating his place of residence to be four hundred miles from Poonah. A cicatrix or scar being observed on the centre of the merchant's nose, he was asked how he came by it; upon which he showed another scar on his forehead, and explained the operation he had undergone. He confessed, that he had been deprived of his nose by the executioner, as a punishment for adultery; and added, that his new one was the work of an artist ho lived where he resided, and who frequently did the ame for others. Upon receiving this account, and immediately thinking of Cowasjee and his fellows, Sir Charles Malet caused the operator to come to Poonah, where he gave new noses to all the five. It was understood at Poonah, that this operator was the only one in India; but that the art had been hereditary in his family, as we have seen it described in that of the Boianis or Boianos of Calbria, and in that of Branca in Sicily. At page 41, I have proposed the question, whether the {Indian} operators, like the ancient ones in Europe, practised the restoration of the lips and ears, as well as that of the nose. The following letter, addressed to me by Colonel Ward, gives a decided answer as to the lips; the artist who came to Poonah having expressed a wish to operate on the eldest son of the British native-ambassador at the Paishwah's court, who had lost part of his upper lip, but who, it appears, did not submit to the experiment: (COPY.) DEAR SIR, In consequence of the conversation I had with you last night about Cowasjee, who had a nose put on at Poonah, in th epresene of Mr Uhthoff and myself, when we belonged to the suite of the late Sir Charles Warre Malet, then ambassador at the above court, I eg to inform you, that the same people who put on the nose said, they were also in the habit of putting on lips; and wanted to perform that operation on the eldest son of our native ambassador at the Paishwah's court, who had lost part of his upper lip: but to this he would not although they told him they agree, had frequently done it with success. I am, Dear Sir, Your obedient humble Servant, J. WARD. November 12th, 1815. MR. CARPUE. [Gaspar Taliacozzo, Bologna, 1546--99: pioneer of nose repairs.] On pp. 36--38, Carpue reproduces the text from the Gentleman's Magazine, but has ``Findlay" for ``Trindlay" (p.37). He also says, ``The same account was subsequently engraved under a tetached portrait of Cowasjee, in which, as in the frmer, the new nose and cicatrix are marked. This portrait is engraved by Mr. W. Nutter, from a painting by Mr. James Wales, of Bombay; and published in London in the year 1793." p. 38 ``Pennant, in his View of Hindoostan, printed in 1798, gives a second description of this practice: \ldots The Hircarrah, or Madras Gazette, of August 5th, 1794, informs us, that Cowasjee, two years before, fell under the displeasure of Tippoo Sultan\ldots. This art is practised by the Koomas, a caste of Hindoos.\footnote{Pennant's View of Hindoostan, 2vols. 4to. 1798, Vol.II, page 237.}" -- p. 39. [Carpue describes, pp. 81--90 (case I), his operation imitating the {Indian} method, performed on 23 October, 1814. The operation lasted a quarter of an hour (p.86), excluding bandaging. 37 mins in all. `On the third day, I took off the dressings\ldots. and I had the high satisfaction to hear the officer, before alluded to, exclaim, from the foot of the bed, ``My G--d, there \emph{is} a nose!" Illustrated by plate 3, facing p.88.]},
