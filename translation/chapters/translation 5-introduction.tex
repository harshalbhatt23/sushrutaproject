\chapter{Kalpasthāna: Introduction}

The \emph{Kalpasthāna} of the \emph{Compendium of Suśruta} is one of
the most important treatises on toxicology surviving from the ancient
world.\footnote{\citet{liu-2021} provides a valuable overview of
    poison treatises in the ancient world, inexplicably omitting mention
    of the \emph{Kalpasthāna}.} Other treatises, such as the
    \emph{\textgreek{θηριακά}} (\emph{On Beasts}) and
    \emph{\textgreek{Ἀλεξίφαρμακα}} (\emph{Antidotes}) of Nicander of
    Colophon (fl.\ second century \BCE) or the \emph{\textgreek{Περὶ τῶν
            ἰοβολῶν θηρίων καὶ δηλητηρίων φαρμάκων}} (\emph{On Venomous 
            Beasts and
        Poisonous Drugs}) by Aelius Promotus (fl.\ ca.\ first century \BCE --
    first century \CE) do not approach the \emph{Kalpasthāna} in length,
    taxonomic detail or organization.\footnote{On Nicander, see

The Nepalese version of the \SS\ reverses the sequence of chapters six and 
seven (see

\section{The Spread of Indian Toxicological Lore to Medieval Islamic  
Authors}

\section{The \emph{Kalpasthāna}'s diffusion}

From the late eighth century onwards, the \emph{Kalpasthāna}, or parts
of it, began to circulate beyond the Indian subcontinent and to
influence medical literature in early Persia, Tibet and Cambodia.

In the late eighth century, the \emph{Kalpasthāna}, as part of the
\SS, was translated into Persian and Arabic at the Abbasid court of
Baghdad by an Indian physician who is often known by the name
Mankah.\footnote{On the name and its variants, see \volcite{IB}[202,
    notes 2, 3]{meul-hist}. For an account of this translation process see
    the account of \citet[14--18]{kahl-2015} and especially his useful
    reconstruction of likely historical events (16--17).}  The principle
    source of information about this translation is the \emph{ʿUyūn
        al-anbā' fī ṭabaqāt al-aṭibbā} of Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah
    (ca.\,1201--1270).\footnote{On Ibn ʿAbī Uṣaybʿiah, see
        \cite{hill-2019}. This author based his information on the earlier
        authors  Abū Ḥafṣ al-Kirmānī (fl.\,ca.\,800) and on an-Nadīm
        (d.\,990). Al-Kirmānī's treatise is unfortunately lost to history and
        known only through citations in other authors (see
        \cite{bosw-1994,blad-2011}).} Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah mentioned that al-Rāzī
        used the \SS, among other Indian works, and that it had been
        translated into Arabic at the orders of the Barmakid Yaḥyā ibn
        Khālid.\footnote{\volcite{3.2}[987]{sava-2019}. Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah said
            the work consisted of ten chapters, which does not match the six books
            of the known \SS.  He listed separately a work on poisonous snakes
            that could have been the \emph{Kalpasthāna} (\emph{ibid}, 989).  On
            the transmission of Sanskrit medical knowledge to Baghdad through the
            influence of the Barmakids, see
            \cites{blad-2011}{shef-2013}{kahl-2015}{wuja-2016a}.}  The \SS\
            passages used by al-Rāzī have been identified and printed in parallel
            with the Arabic translation by
            \citeauthor{kahl-2015}.\footnote{\cite[76--82]{kahl-2015}.
                Unfortunately, Kahl (p.\,14) accepted the impossible dating of a
                medical author Suśruta to the sixth century \BCE, in spite of citing
                \citeauthor{meul-hist}, \emph{HIML}, amongst his references. However,
                his remarks dating the redaction of the \SS\ to the period third-sixth
                century \CE\ are not incorrect.}
                
Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah gave a detailed description of the translation in
Baghdad of a work that was almost certainly the \emph{Kalpasthāna}:
\begin{quote}
Shānāq was the author of several books, notably: 1.\ On poisons, in
five parts. Mankah al-Hindī translated it from Sanskrit into Persian,
and a man by the name of Abū Ḥātim al-Balkhī was assigned the task of
transcribing it in Persian writing; he then expounded upon it to Yaḥyā
ibn Khālid ibn Barmak. The work was subsequently translated [into
Arabic] for the caliph al-Maʾmūn by his client, al-ʿAbbās ibn Saʿīd
al-Jawharī. The latter was also assigned the task of reading it aloud
to al-Ma’mūn.\fvolcite{3.2}[990]{sava-2019}
\end{quote}
There are several interesting features of this account, some of which
have been discussed elsewhere.\footnote{E.g., in the notes to the
    translation of \citeauthor{sava-2019}, in \volcite{IA}[352]{meul-hist}
    and elsewhere. It has not been remarked before that the interpreter
    Abū Ḥātim al-Balkhī was from Balkh, the original home of the Buddhist
    Barmakid family.}  As the pioneering work of \citeauthor{stra-1934}
    showed, the \emph{Poison Book} of “Shanaq” contained material directly
    translated from the first chapter of the
    \emph{Kalpasthāna}.\footnote{The passages cited by
        \citet[14--19]{stra-1934} include quite literal translations of
        \emph{Kalpasthāna} 1.37, 1.40, 1.42, 1.29--34cd, 1.47, 1.51cd--52,
        1.69, and the famous characterization of a poisoner at 1.19cd--23 (see
        above, p.\,\pageref{poisoner}).  The translator of this Arabic work
        may only have been aware of chapter 1 of the \emph{Kalpasthāna}.} The
        reception of these materials from the \SS\ under the name “Shanaq”
        remains a historical puzzle.\footnote{Most scholars agree that this is
            a Perso-Arabic reception of the Sanskrit name Cāṇakya, but that name
            was associated not with the \SS, but with the \emph{Arthaśāstra}
            during or after the time of the Gupta empire
            \citep[33--36]{oliv-2013}.  The suggestion that it may be “Śaunaka” is
            not supportable \volcite{1A}[150--152]{meul-hist}.} Several other
            Islamic authors knew and cited the \SS.\footnote{Listed with
                references in \volcite{1A}[352]{meul-hist}.}
                                
The \SS\ was also a formative source for later Arabic works on
toxicology.  One of the earliest mentions of Shanaq is made in ibn
Wahshiya's \emph{Book on Poisons} (ca.\,950). He refers to Shanaq's
book as great and important. This statement is attested to by the fact
that much of Shanaq's work was used by ibn
Wahshiya.\footcite[6]{leve-1966}
                                
The author Suśruta was also cited as a famous authority in Tibetan
lexicographical literature of the early ninth
century.\fvolcite{IA}[352]{meul-hist}
                                
Shortly after this time, inscriptional evidence by King Yaśovarman I
(r.\,889--910) shows that the \SS\ was known in
Cambodia.\footnote{\emph{Idem}.}

%\begin{quote}
%    Mankah al-Hindī  was knowledgeable about the art of medicine,

%philosopher of the previously mentioned group in the Indian
%sciences. He was also conversant with the Sanskrit and Persian
%languages: it was he who translated Shānāq’s \emph{On poisons}
%from Sanskrit to Persian. Mankah was a contemporary of Hārūn
%al-Rashīd, and during the latter’s caliphate he travelled from
%India to Iraq, where he met with the caliph and treated
%him.\footnote{Translation from
