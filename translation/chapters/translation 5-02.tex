\chapter{Kalpasthāna 2: Poisonous Plants}

\section{Introduction}

This section begins with several lists of poisonous plants.  The
Sanskrit names for these plants are mostly not standard or familiar
from anywhere in Sanskrit or ethnobotanical literature.  It remains a
historical puzzle why these particular names are so difficult to
interpret. However, we are not the first to encounter these
difficulties. 

In the eleventh century, Cakrapāṇidatta commentated on 
a similar list of poisons in the \CS, and referred to the \SS\ on the 
topic.\footnote{\Cakra{6.23.11}{571}.}   He 
also noted that,
\begin{quote}
    In assigning the names to these plants, the main authorities are
the Kirātas and Śabaras, who know about these things because they
can explain these matters on the basis of a succession of
teachers.\footnote{Cakrapāṇidatta on \CS\ \Su{6.23.11}{571}.}
\end{quote}
\par
\noindent
About a century later, the learned commentator on the \SS, Ḍalhaṇa, 
remarked,
\begin{quote}
    \label{kiratas}
In spite of having made the greatest effort, it has been impossible to
identify these plants. In the Himalayan regions, Kirātas and Śabaras
are able to identify them.\footnote{After \SS, \emph{kalpasthāna} 2.5
    \citep[564]{vulgate}.}
\end{quote}
From the view of Sanskrit authors, Kirātas and Śabaras were tribal
peoples.\footnote{Both communities are mentioned in Sanskrit
    literature from antiquity.  The Kirātas are associated especially with
    Eastern Nepal, the Himalayan and north-eastern regions of South Asia,
    while the Śabara people are mainly associated with Odisha and West
    Bengal.  Representative studies on these communities include
    \citet{chat-1951,sing-2008,roy-1970,elwi-1955,subb-1999,rai-2019a,sing-1990}.}
     
In the tenth or eleventh century, the author Bhikṣu Govinda cast his
alchemical treatise as a dialogue with a Kirāta king called Madana who
was a master of the alchemical art.\footcite[IIA, 620]{meul-hist}  So
there was an awareness amongst Sanskrit medical and alchemical authors
of that period that different populations were a source of specialized
knowledge in these domains, and the Sanskrit authors were open to
these sources and indeed depended on them.

Ḍalhaṇa also recorded variant readings of these poison names from the
manuscripts that he consulted of the lost commentary of Gayadāsa
(fl.\,c.\,\AD\ 1000). The identities of these poisons have thus been
in doubt for at least a thousand years.\footnote{See
    \cite[80--81]{wuja-2003}.} Firm identification has in many cases been
    equally impossible for us today.

One path for exploration in this situation is to attempt to
reverse-engineer some identifications by considering the known toxic
plants of India.\footnote{Valuable reference sources on Indian plant
    toxicology in general include \cite[chs.\,10, 11]{pill-2013} and
    \cite[parts 1.II, 3 and 4]{barc-2008}. More generally \citet[41 et
    passim]{bown-2001} comments usefully of herbs in general that “it
    goes without saying that if they can do good, they must contain
    substances that in excess can poison.”  See for a general list of poisonous 
    plants, see \cite{wiki-2025a}.}

%\section{Manuscript notes}
\subsection{Shock}

An important new topic introduced in this chapter (34--39) is that of “toxic
shock” (\emph{vega}).\sse{vega}{toxic shock}  When a patient has been 
poisoned, the effect of the toxin is expressed in their body in seven waves or 
pulses, \emph{vegas}.  At each stage, symptoms are slightly different and a 
different therapeutic regime is prescribed (40--44).  

The Sanskrit term \emph{vega} has a range of uses, from “impulse” to
“urge, jerk, rush, speed,” or “impetus.”  It appears in the
well-known passage in the \CS\ about avoiding illness not ignoring 
or suppressing “natural urges,” \emph{vegas}, such
as the desire to urinate.\footnote{See \CS\ \Ca{1.7}{49--55}, discussed and
    translated in \cite[7--8, 15--17]{wuja-2003}.}
    
According to the author of the \AS, Ālambāyana\label{alambayana1} was
the ancient authority who declared that the seven \se{vega}{pulses}
of toxic shocks affect, successively, the seven
\se{āśraya}{substrata} of the body, from blood to semen, and
Dhanvantari originated the idea that this applied to victims of
snake-bite.\footnote{\AS\ \As{6.40.35}{844}: \dev{sapteti vegā
    mūrchādyā videhapatinā smṛtāḥ//34// raktamāṃsavasāsnāyu
    tathā'sthyādyāstrayaḥ kramāt/ āśrayāḥ sapta
    saptānāmityālambāyano'bravīt//35//}.  The following verse named
    Dhanvantari as the originator of the idea that toxic pulses are
    experienced specifically by a person bitten by a snake 
    (\dev{vegāndhanvantaristadvatsarpadaṣṭasya manyate/} 36ab).  The
    commentator Indu noted that Dhanvantari was the teacher of Suśruta, i.e., 
    that “Dhanvantari" was shorthand for \SS.    
    On Ālambāyana, see p.\,\pageref{alambayana2}, note \ref{alambayana2}.}
    
The commentator Indu (fl.\,1000--1150) cited verses by Ālambāyana
asserting that the pipes in the body carry poison to the heart, but
that the heart can be protected by ghee. \footnote{\AS\ \As{6.40.60}{}:
    \dev{yāḥ sirāḥ sarvagātreṣu hṛdaye sampratiṣṭhitāḥ| tābhirasya viṣaṃ
    sarvaṃ hṛdayaṃ sampradhāvati// ghṛtena tu praticchannaṃ viṣaṃ nāti
    prapīḍayet/ nirvāṇajananaṃ sarpiḥ prāṇināṃ prāṇavarddhanam//
    hṛdayāvaraṇāstadvadbhakṣyā bhojyāśca sāgadāḥ//}}

And now I shall explain \diff{\se{vijñānīya}{required knowledge}}
about stationary poisons.\footnote{No reference is made to
    Dhanvantari \citep[see][]{birc-2021}. “Stationary” here is a term
    contrasted with “moving,” and signifies plants as opposed to animals
    and insects.}

    \noindent It is said that there are two kinds of poisons,
    \se{sthāvara}{stationary} and \se{jaṅgama}{mobile}. The former
    dwells in ten sites, the latter in sixteen places.
   
    \item[4]
    Traditionally, the ten are: root, leaf, fruit, flower, bark,
    \se{kṣīra}{milky sap}, \se{sāra}{pith}, \se{niryāsa}{resin}, 
    \sepl{dhātu}{mineral}, and the tuber.

People should know that root-poisons cause \se{udveṣṭana}{writhing},
\se{pralāpa}{ranting}, and \se{moha}{delirium}, and  leaf-poisons
cause yawning, writhing, and \se{śvāsa}{wheezing}.
    
 Fruit-poisons cause swelling of the
   scrotum, a burning feeling and writhing.  Flower-poisons will
    cause vomiting, \se{ādhmāna}{distension} and \se{svāpa}{sleep}.  
    
The consumption of poisons from bark, \se{sāra}{pith} and
\se{niryāsa}{resin} will cause foul breath, \se{pāruṣya}{hoarseness},
a headache, and a discharge of \se{kapha}{phlegm}.\footnote{At

    Because of dryness, it may cause inflammation of the wind; because of heat

    %21
    Because of the sharpness it unhinges the
    mind, and it cuts through the connections with the \skt{sensitive
        points}{marman}.  Because it is rarified it can infiltrate and distort
    the parts of the body.\footnote{We read the active \emph{vikaroti} with 
    Ḍalhaṇa against the 
    transmitted passive \emph{vikriyeta}, since it must be the parts of the body 
    that are distorted, not the poison.}    
    

\item[22]
Because it is fast-acting it kills quickly, and because of its pervasiveness
it affects one's \skt{whole physical constitution}{prakṛti}.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa
on \Su{5.2.22}{565} explained this as “\se{akhiladehavyāptirūpam}{takes the
form of pervading the whole body}.”}  Because of its expansiveness it enters
into the \se{doṣa}{humour}s, \se{dhātu}{bodily constiuents}s, and even the
impurities\sskt{impurity}{mala}.  Because it is limpid it overflows, and
because it is light it is difficult to treat.  Because it is indigestible it
is hard to eliminate.  Therefore, it causes suffering for a long time.
    
    \item[ 24]
    Any poison that is instantly lethal, whether it be
    stationary, mobile, or artificial, will be known to 
    have all ten of these qualities.

else dried up by blazing fire, wind, or sunshine, or which has
just spontaneously lost its features,\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa
    specified that this refers to the ten qualities that are
    mentioned above (\Su{5.2.26}{565}).} becomes a
    \skt{slow-acting poison}{dūṣīviṣa}.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa cited
        this verse at \Su{1.46.83}{222} while explaining
        \emph{dūṣīviṣa} (see p.\,\pageref{dusivisa}.} Because it has
        lost its potency it is no longer perceived.  Because it is
        surrounded by \se{kapha}{phlegm} it has an aftermath that
        lasts for a very long time.

If he is suffering from this, the colour of his stools changes, he
gets a sour, bad taste and is very thirsty. Speaking nonsensically and
close to death, wandering about, he may feel faint, giddy, and
aroused.\footnote{Similar symptoms of slow-acting poison are described
    at \Su{2.7.11--13}{296} in the context of 
    \se{duṣyodara}{contamination dropsy}.  This this may explain why the

        \item[28]
        If it lodges in his \se{āmāśaya}{stomach}, he becomes sick because of wind

    limbs}.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa \Su{5.2.30ab}{565} glossed “disjunction” as the
loss of function of the joints in regard to movement.} Next, it causes
\se{annamada}{intoxication from food} and indigestion, \se{arocaka}{loss
    of appetite}, the condition of having a \se{koṭha}{skin disease} with
\se{maṇḍala}{round blotches},\footnote{The last ailment could perhaps be

at \Su{6.39.52}{675}, as an accumulation of phlegm in the joints.  Its

    possible to detect the evolution of the Nepalese \dev{avasīdet} to

same is the case at \Su{5.5.24}{575} and the clear description at
