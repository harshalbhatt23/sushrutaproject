“Now I shall narrate the chapter on the origin of this
knowledge.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa understood the word
    “\se{veda}{knowledge}" as specifically  “medical knowledge." He
    said that the word  “longevity" (\emph{āyur}) \ssaneng{āyur}{life,
    longevity} had been elided. %

“Now, as is well-known, Aupadhenava, Vaitaraṇa, Aurabhra,
Puṣkalāvata, Karavīra, Gopurarakṣita, \diff{Bhoja}, Suśruta and
others addressed Lord Divodāsa, king of Kāśi, the best of the
immortals, who was in his ashram surrounded by an entourage of
sages.\footnote{On these persons, see \cite[IA 361--363,
    369\,ff.]{meul-hist}. \label{Bhoja}
    The authority Bhoja does not appear in the list
    as published in the vulgate edition \citep[1]{susr-trikamji2}, and
    was not included in \cite{meul-hist} amongst “authorities mentioned
    in the \SS.” \citeauthor{meul-hist} gathered textual evidence about
    Bhoja at \cite[IA 690--691]{meul-hist}. \citet{kleb-2021a} has
    discussed these authors in the context of an anonymous commentary on
    the \SS\ that cites them.}

    that people say,” see \cite[400--401]{wuja-2022}.} Before creating
    people, Svayambhū composed it in hundreds of thousands of verses and
    a thousand chapters and, after observing the short lifespan and low

whole knowledge of surgery accessible, teach it to us,
Lord”.\footnote{For discussion of the text-critical significance of
    this passage, see \cite{hari-2013}. I have read the passage as
    including the word \dev{alaṅkṛtvā} in the sense “make accessible”

    \item[14--16] 

“Now, as is well-known, the aim of Āyurveda is eliminating the
disease of one who has been assailed by disease and protecting the
healthy; Āyurveda is, “where they find a long life,” or “that by
which long life is known.” You should take in its best
\se{aṅga}{component}, which is being taught without conflicting with
tradition, perception, inference or analogy.
    
    \item[17] 
    
“For this component is first, the most important, because it is
referred to first; it cures wounds and joins together the most
important thing, Yajña's head. For, just as it has been said of old,
`the head that had been cut off by Rudra was joined again by the two
Aśvins.'
    
    \item[18] 
    
    “And also, of the eight disciplines of Āyurveda, alone is the best
because of the quick action of its \se{kriyā}{procedures}, its
application of blunt instruments, knives, caustics and fire, and
it is common to all disciplines.
    
    \item[19] 
    
"Therefore, it is eternal, meritorious, leads to heaven,
brings renown, bestows a long life, and affords a livelihood.
    
    \item[20] 
    
“This is what Brahmā said: `Prajāpati learned it. From him, the
Aśvins. From the Aśvins, Indra. From Indra, I. In this world, I will
transmit it to students, for the benefit of people.'
    
  \item[21]   
  
“There a verse about this:   
    \begin{sloka}
        For I am Dhanvantari, the first god, the remover of old age,
pain and death of mortals. Having understood surgery, the
best of the great knowledge systems, I arrived on earth again
to teach it here.\footnote{Note that this verse about the
    origin of surgery is the first place that the name
    “Dhanvantari” is introduced in the Nepalese version of the
    work. Dhanvantari is here identified with Brahmā, the creator
    of the world. For discussion, see \cite{birc-2021}.}

    \item[22] 
    
“In this context, as far as this discipline is concerned, a
\se{puruṣa}{human being} is called an amalgam of the five elements
and the embodied soul.  This is where \se{kriyā}{procedures} apply.
This is the locus.”
    
“Why?”
    
“Because of the duality of the world, the world is twofold: the
stationary and the moving. Its \se{ātmaka}{nature} is twofold,
depending on the preponderance of Agni and
Soma.\footcite[See][]{wuja-2004}  Alternatively, it can be considered
as being fivefold.  The multitude of beings in it are fourfold: they
are termed “sweat-born, stone-born, caul-born and
egg-born”.\footnote{This fourfold classification of beings is
    paralleled with closely-related vocabulary in  \emph{Bhelasaṃhitā}
    4.4.4 \parencites[206]{kris-2000}[81]{mook-1921}.}  Where they are
    concerned, the human being is the main thing; others are his support.
    Therefore, the \se{puruṣa}{human being} is the locus.
    
    \item[23--26]  

“Diseases are said to be the conjunction of the person and
\se{duḥkha}{suffering}. There are four of them: invasive, bodily,
mental and inherent.  The invasive ones are caused by an injury.  The
bodily ones are based on food, caused by
\se{vaiṣamya}{irregularities} in wind, bile, phlegm and
blood.\footnote{Note that four humoral substances are assumed here.}
    
“The \se{mānasa}{mental} ones, caused by 
    \se{icchā}{desire} and 
    \se{dveṣa}{hatred}, 
    include:  
    \se{krodha}{anger},

    \se{lobha}{greed}.
    
“The \se{svābhāvika}{inherent} ones are hunger, thirst, old age, death, 
    sleep and  those of the \se{prakṛti}{temperament}.
    
“These too are \se{adhiṣṭhāna}{located} in the mind and body.

    \se{saṃśamana}{pacification},

    \se{ācāra}{regimen}, 
    properly employed, bring about their cure.
    
    
    \item [28] 
    
“Furthermore, food is the  \se{mūla}{root} of living beings as well as
of \se{bala}{strength}, \se{varṇa}{complexion} and \se{ojas}{vital
    energy}. It \se{āyatta}{depends on} the six \se{rasa}{flavours}.
Flavours, furthermore, have substances as their
\se{āśrayin}{substrate}.  And substances are
\se{oṣadhī-}{remedies}.\footnote{Pāṇini 6.3.132 provides that the
    final vowel of the noun \emph{oṣadhi} may be lengthened
    (\emph{$\rightarrow$oṣadhī}) under certain conditions.  These
    conditions require that the word be used in a Vedic mantra and not in
    the nominative.  Neither condition is met in this passage, yet the
    author uses the form \emph{oṣadhī}. This form is in fact not uncommon
    in medical literature as well as in epics, purāṇas, smṛtis, and other
    parts of Sanskrit literature.} There are two types:
    \se{sthāvara}{stationary} and \se{jaṅgama}{moving}.
    
    
    
    \item [29]  
    
“Of these, there are four types of stationary ones:
\se{vanaspati}{fruit trees}, \se{vṛkṣa}{flowering trees},
\se{oṣadhi}{herbs} and
\se{vīrudh}{shrubs}.\footnote{Ca.sū.1.71--72 also describes these
    four types of medicinal plant in similar terms but with slightly
    differing names: \emph{oṣadhi} is a plant that ends after
    fruiting, \emph{vīrudh} is a plant that branches out,
    \emph{vanaspati} is a tree with fruit, and \emph{vānaspatya} is a
    tree with fruit and flowers.} Amongst these, the “fruit trees”
    have fruit but no flowers.\footnote{The MSS agree in reading
        \emph{phalavantyaḥ} “having flowers” which is grammatically
        non-standard. This form is also found in the 
        \emph{Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa} (1.92.27,
        \cite[1.92.27][56r]{sarm-1912}).}  The “flowering trees” have
        flowers and fruit.  The “herbs” die when the fruit is ripe.
        “Shrubs” put out shoots.
    
    % \citep{ober-2003} didn't have anything on phalavantyo that I could find quickly.

“As is well known, moving remedies are also of four types: those
\se{jarāyuja}{born in in a caul}, those \se{aṇḍaja}{born from eggs},
those \se{svedaja}{born of sweat}, and \se{udbhid}{shoots}. Amongst
these, those born in a caul include \se{paśu}{animals}, humans, and
\se{vyāla}{wild animals}.  Birds, \se{sarīsṛpa}{creepy-crawlies} and
snakes are “born of eggs.” \se{kṛmi}{Worms}, \se{kunta}{small
    insects} and \se{pipīlika}{ants} and others are born of
sweat.\footnote{The word \emph{kunta}, though marked as “lexical” in
    most dictionaries, is in fact found in literature, commonly as a
    compound with \emph{pipīlika}; the compound sometimes seems to be
    understood a type of ant (\emph{tatpuruṣa} compound) rather than as a
    pair of insects (\emph{dvandva} compound).}  Shoots include
    \se{indragopa}{red velvet mites} and \se{maṇḍūka}{frogs}.\footnote{On

 “There is a verse about this:
    \begin{sloka}
        This seed of medicine has been declared in brief.  Its explanation will be given in one 
        hundred and twenty chapters.\footnote{This is the number of chapters in the first 
        five sections of the work, namely the  \emph{Sūtra-, Nidāna-, Śārīra-, Cikitsā-} 
        and \emph{Kalpa-sthāna}s. These have 46, 16, 10, 40 and 8 chapters respectively.  The 
        \emph{Uttaratantra} has 66 chapters.}

“There are one hundred and twenty chapters in five
\se{adhyāya}{sections}.\footnote{On \emph{viṃśa} in the sense of
    “greater by 20” see P.5.2.46 \emph{śadantaviṃśateś ca}.}  In that
    regard, having divided them, according to their subject matter, into
    the Ślokasthāna, the Nidāna, the Śārīra, the Cikitsita and the Kalpa,
    we shall mention this in the Uttaratantra.\footnote{The end of this
        sentence reads oddly.  The vulgate edition adds an object: “[we shall
        mention] the remaining topics [in the Uttara]” which smooths out the
        difficulty, but this is supported in none of the Nepalese MSS.  At
        the start of the Uttaratantra \citep[1.3--4ab]{vulgate} there is
        indeed a statement that picks up the point about there being 120
        chapters.}

“There is a verse about this:
\begin{sloka}
    Someone who reads this eternal proclamation of the King of
    Kāśī, that was declared by Svayambhu, will have good karma on earth, will
    be respected by kings and upon death will achieve the world of Śakra.
