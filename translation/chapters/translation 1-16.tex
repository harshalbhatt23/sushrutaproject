\chapter{Sūtrasthāna 16: Repairing Pierced Ears}

\section{Literature}

Meulenbeld offered an annotated overview of this chapter and a
bibliography of earlier scholarship to
2002.\fvolcite{IA}[211--212317]{meul-hist}  A book on this topic, arising
out of the present project, with edition, translation and discussion of
the Nepalese transmission is published by \cite{wuja-2023}.


\section{Translation}

\begin{translation}    
  
\item [1] 

Now we shall expound the method for piercing the ear.\footnote{The topic of 
    \se{kaṛnavyadha}{piercing the ear} is not discussed in the \emph{Carakasaṃhitā}
    (\cite[IB, 326, n.\,175]{meul-hist}), but it is mentioned in some texts that
    followed the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā}, such as the \emph{Kaśāpyasaṃhitā} \citep[IIA,
    30]{meul-hist}. Also, the instrument for piercing the ear is described in the
    \emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā} \Ah{1.26.26}{321}. In the versions of the text known
    to Ḍalhaṇa \citep[76]{vulgate} and Cakrapāṇidatta \citep[125]{acar-1939}, the
    heading of this chapter is “the method of piercing and joining the ear”
    (\dev{karṇavyadhabandhavidhi}), instead of the Nepalese version's “the method of
    piercing the ear” (\dev{karṇavyadhavidhi}). The topic of joining the ear
    (\dev{karṇabandha}) is discussed in passages 17--20 of the Nepalese version.
    However, it appears that only subsequent redactors reflected its importance by
    including it in chapter headings.

 The Nepalese version also omits the opening remark on Dhanvantari that appears in
subsequent versions of the text. For a discussion of the frame story in the
Nepalese version, see \cite{birc-2021}. 

When commenting on this statement, Ḍalhaṇa \citep[76]{vulgate} and
Cakrapāṇidatta \citep[125]{acar-1939} observed that only the ears of healthy
people should be pierced, and they quoted the lost authority Bhoja to affirm
this: “When piercing the ears of children who are free of disease at these
times, their ear flaps and apertures, as well as limbs, increase” (\Su{1.16.1}{76}).

Some texts use the adjective \dev{karṇa-vedhanī} rather than \dev{°vyadhanī}.}

\item [2] 

One may pierce a child's ears for the purpose of preserving and decorating. During the
bright fortnight, when the child is in the sixth or seventh month, on renowned
days, half days, hours and constellations, the physician, with a calming presence,
sits the boy, who has received a benediction and the recitation of a
blessing,\footnote{The causative form \dev{vyadhayet} is known in Classical
    Sanskrit \citep[166]{whit-root}.

The compound \dev{kṛtamaṅgalasvastivācanaṃ} “who has received a benediction and
the recitation of a blessing” is an emendation based on the similar text at
\Su{3.2.25}{346}.  Cf.\ also \Su{3.10.8, 24}{388, 390} that have slightly
different formulations.} on the lap of a wet-nurse.\footnote{The versions of
    1.16.3 known to Cakrapāṇidatta \citep[126]{acar-1939} and Ḍalhaṇa
    \citep[76]{vulgate} have the additional compound \dev{kumāradharāṅke} (“on the
    lap of one who holds the child”) after \dev{dhātryaṅke}. The gender of
    \dev{kumāradhara} is made clear by  Ḍalhaṇa's gloss “a man who holds the child.”
    Also, both versions add \dev{bālakrīḍanakaiḥ pralobhya} (“having enticed with
    children's toys”) to indicate that the child should be tempted with toys to stay
    on the assistant's lap. According to Ḍalhaṇa on \Su{1.16.3}{76}, the toys include
    replica elephants, horses, bulls and parrots. Ḍalhaṇa further mentions that others
    read \dev{bhakṣyaviśeṣairvā} (“or by special treats”) before
    \dev{bālakrīḍanakaiḥ}, but we see no trace of these small kindnesses in our
    witnesses.} Then, he should pull the ear with his left hand 
    and pierce straight through with his right hand at a naturally-occurring
    cleft.\footnote{The versions of 1.16.3 of Cakrapāṇidatta \citep[126]{acar-1939}
        and Ḍalhaṇa \citep[76]{vulgate} add that this naturally-occurring cleft is
        illuminated by a ray of sunshine  (\dev{ādityakarāvabhāsite}).

The syntax of this slightly long sentence is unusual because of the dual
object \dev{tau} “the two (ears)” at the start of the sentence, which is remote
from the main verb.  The other singular accusatives referring to the ear being
pierced are governed by absolutives.} For a boy, do the right ear first; for a
girl, do the left one. Use a needle on a thin ear; an \seEngOnly{ārā}{awl} on a thick
one.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa on 1.16.3 \citep[76]{vulgate} clarifies that the awl is a
    shoe-maker's knife for piercing leather.  He also cites the authority of “the
    notes of Lakṣmaṇa” (\emph{Lakṣmaṇaṭippaṇaka}) on the issue of the thickness of the
    needle. \textit{The Notes of Lakṣmaṇa} is not known from any earlier or
    contemporary sources and was presumably a collection of glosses on the \SS\ that
    was available to Ḍalhaṇa in twelfth-century Bengal. See \citet[IA,
    386]{meul-hist}.}
        
\item [3]  
    
One may know that it was pierced in the wrong place if there is excess blood or
too much pain. The absence of side-effects is a sign that it has been pierced in the right
place.\footnote{At this point, \MScite{Kathmandu KL 699} is missing a folio, so
    the rest of this chapter is constructed on the basis of witnesses
    \MScite{Kathmandu NAK 5-333} and \MScite{Kathmandu NAK 1-1079}.}
    
\item [4] 
 
In this context, if an ignorant person randomly pierces a \seEngOnly{sirā}{duct}
there will be fever, burning, \seEngOnly{śvayathu}{swelling}, pain, 
\seEngOnly{granthi}{lumps},
\seEngOnly{manyāstambhā}{paralysis of the nape of the neck}, 
\seEngOnly{apatānaka}{convulsions},
headache or sharp pain in the ear.\footnote{This passage is significantly
    augmented in Cakrapāṇidatta's and Ḍalhaṇa's versions, to outline the specific
    problems caused by piercing three ducts called \dev{kālikā}, \dev{marmikā} and
    \dev{lohitikā} (1.16.4 \citep[126]{acar-1939} and 1.16.5 \citep[77]{vulgate}
    respectively). In fact, the order of the problems mentioned in the Nepalese
    version has been retained in the other versions and divided between each duct.
    Cakrapāṇidatta's commentary on 1.16.4 \citep[126]{acar-1939} cites several verses
    attributed to Bhoja on the problems caused by piercing these three ducts in the
    ear flap: `\dev{lohitikā}, \dev{marmikā} and the black ones are the ducts
    situated in the earflaps.  Listen in due order to the problems that arise when
    they are pierced. Paralysis of the nape of the neck and convulsions, or sharp pain
    arise from piercing \dev{lohitikā}. Pain and lumps are thought to arise from
    piercing \dev{marmikā}. Piercing \dev{kālikā} gives rise to swelling, fever and
    burning.'}
    
\item[5]     
    
Having removed the \se{vartti}{wick} because of the accumulation of humours or
an unsatisfactory piercing at that location,\footnote{In addition to these
    reasons, Ḍalhaṇa at \Su{1.16.6}{77} added “because of piercing with
    a painful, crooked and unsatisfactory needle”
    (\dev{kliṣṭajihmāpraśastasūcīvyadhāt}) and “because of a wick that is too
    thick” (\dev{gāḍhataravartitvāt}). Ḍalhaṇa was aware of the reading in the
    Nepalese version because in his commentary on \Su{1.16.6}{77} he noted that
    some read “because of the accummulation of humours” rather than “because of
    piercing with a painful, crooked and unsatisfactory needle or because of a
    wick that is too thick.” On the concept of humoral
    \se{samudāya}{accumulation}, see the important analysis by \citet{meul-1992}.}
    he should smear it with barley, liquorice, 
    \gls{mañjiṣṭhā},
    and the root of the 
    \gls{gandharvahasta},
    thickened with honey and ghee. And when it has healed well, he should pierce
    it again.\footnote{The description of the drug is ambigious: the word “root”
        could be taken with each plant, or just with the last.  The vulgate reads just
        “castor oil root” so we assume that is the traditional interpretation.}
    
\item[6] 
    
He should treat the properly-pierced ear by sprinkling it with raw sesame
oil.   After every three days one should make a thicker
\seEngOnly{varti}{wick} and do the very same sprinkling.\footnote{Describing
    ear and nose operations similar to those here, Celsus described the use of a
    quill (Latin \emph{pinna}) where the Sanskrit authors use a cotton wick
    (\emph{De Medicina} VII \P10--11, \volcite{3}[366--367]{spen-1935}).}
    %\footnote{The manuscripts support the reading
    %    \dev{sthūlatarīṃ} that is either a non-standard form or a scribal
    % error.}
    
\item[7] 
    
Once the ear is free from humours or side-effects, one should put in a light
\se{pravardhanaka}{dilator} in order to enlarge it
enough.\footnote{Cakrapāṇidatta on 1.16.6 \citep[127]{acar-1939} and Ḍalhaṇa
    on 1.16.8 \citep[77]{vulgate} pointed out that the dilator can be made of
    wood, such as that of the \gls{apāmārga}, the  \gls{nimba} and  \gls{kārpāsa}.
    Ḍalhaṇa added that it can also be made of \seEngOnly{sīsaka}{lead} and should
    have the shape of the \gls{dhattūra} flower. The manuscripts have variant
    readings for \dev{laghupravardhanakamāmuñcet} at this point that include a
    scribal emendation, none of which construe plausibly. It is possible that the
    unusual verb form \dev{ā}+$\surd$\dev{muc} puzzled the scribes and caused the
    implausible scribal readings and emendations.}
    
\item[8]
    
\begin{em}
A person's ear enlarged in this way can split in two, either as a result of the 
humours\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa on 1.16.9  \citep[77]{vulgate} notes that the word \dev{doṣa} 
here can refer to either a humour, such as \seEngOnly{vāta}{wind}, as we have 
understood it, or a 
disease generated from a humour.} or a blow.\\ Listen to me about the 
\seEngOnly{sandhāna}{ways of joining} 
it can have. 
    \end{em}
    
\item[9]
    
Here, there are, in brief, fifteen ways of mending the ear flap.\footnote{The Nepalese version 
uses the word \dev{sandhāna} to refer to joining a split in an ear flap, which is consistent 
with the terminology in the verse cited above (8). However, 1.16.10 of Ḍalhaṇa's version 
\citep[77]{vulgate} uses the term \dev{bandha} here and at the very beginning of the 
chapter (i.e., 1.16.1) to introduce the topic of repairing the ear.}  They are as follows:
    \se{nemīsandhānaka}{Rim-join}, \se{utpalabhedyaka}{Lotus-splittable}, 
    \se{vallūraka}{Dried Flesh}, \se{āsaṅgima}{Fastening}, \se{gaṇḍakarṇa}{Cheek-ear}, 
    \se{āhārya}{Take away}, \se{nirvedhima}{Ready-Split}, \se{vyāyojima}{Multi-joins}, 
    \se{kapāṭasandhika}{Door-hinge}, \se{ardhakapāṭasandhika}{Half door-hinge}, 
    \se{saṃkṣipta}{Compressed}, \se{hīnakarṇa}{Reduced-ear},
    \se{vallīkarṇa}{Creeper-ear}, \se{yaṣṭīkarṇa}{Stick-ear}, and \se{kākauṣṭha}{Crow's lip}.\footnote{For an artist's impression of these different kinds of joins in the ear flap, see \cite[290]{majn-1975} (reproduced as Figure 3.2 in \cite[154]{wuja-2003}).}
    
    In this context, among these, 
%    \begin{description}[nosep] %[itemsep=0pt]

These ten options for \seEngOnly{sandhi}{joins} of the ear should be
bound.  They can mostly be explained as resembling their
names.\footnote{Cakrapāṇidatta on 1.16.9–13 \citep[128–129]{acar-1939} and Ḍalhaṇa
    on \Su{1.16.10}{77–78} provide examples of how the names of these joins describe
    their shapes. For example, the \se{nemīsandhānaka}{rim-join} is similar to the
    join of the \se{cakradhārā}{rim of a wheel}.}  The five from
    \se{saṃkṣipta}{compressed} on are incurable.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa on
        \Su{1.16.10}{77–78} mentions that some do not read the statement that only five
        are incurable, and they understand the causes of unsuccessful joins given below
        (i.e., heat, inflammation, suppuration and swelling) as also pertaining to the
        first ten when they do heal.}  Among these, “Compressed” has a dry ear canal and
        the other flap is small.   “Reduced ear” has flaps that have no base and have
        wasted flesh on their edges. “Creeper-ear” has flaps that are thin and uneven.
        “Stick-ear” has \seEngOnly{granthita}{lumpy} flesh and the flaps are stretched thin 
        and
        have \seEngOnly{stabdha}{stiff} \seEngOnly{sirā}{ducts}.  “Crow-lip” has a flap 
        without flesh
        with \seEngOnly{saṃkṣipta}{compressed} tips and little blood. Even when they are 
        bound
        up, they do not heal because they are hot, inflamed, 
        \seEngOnly{srāva}{suppurating}, or
        swollen.\footnote{The version of 1.16.11–13 known to Ḍalhaṇa \citep[78]{vulgate}
            has four verses (\dev{śloka}) at this point that are not in the Nepalese
            manuscripts. The additional verses iterate the types of joins required for ear
            flaps that are missing, elongated, thick, wide, etc. All four verses were probably
            absent in the version of the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} known to Cakrapāṇidatta. He
            cites the verses separately in his commentary, the \emph{Bhānumatī}
            \citep[128–129]{acar-1939}, introducing each one as 'some people read' (\dev{ke
            citpaṭhanti}). However,  in Trikamajī Ācārya's edition of the \emph{Sūtrasthāna}
            of the \emph{Bhānumatī}, the root text is largely identical to the one commented
            on by Ḍalhaṇa (\cite{vulgate}), even in instances like this where Cakrapāṇidatta's
            commentary indicates that he was reading a different version of the
            \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā}. See further the discussion on p.\,\pageref{skinflap}
            above.}

A person wishing to perform a join of any of these should therefore have
supplies specially prepared according to the recommendations of the
“Preparatory Supplies” chapter.\footnote{\emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā}
    \Su{1.5}{18–23}, probably verse 6 especially, that lists the equipment and
    medications that a surgeon should have ready.}  And in this regard, he should
    particularly gather\footnote{The reading in the Nepalese manuscripts of
        \dev{viśeṣataścāgropaharaṇīyāt} has been emended to
        \dev{viśeṣataścātropaharet} to make sense of the list of ingredients, which is
        in the accusative case. Also, the repetition of \dev{agropaharaṇīyāt} in the
        Nepalese version suggests that its second occurrence, which does not make good
        sense here, is a dittographic error.} \gls{surāmaṇḍa}, milk,
        water, \gls{dhānyāmla}, and
        \se{kapālacūrṇa}{powdered earthenware crockery}.\footnote{The term
            \dev{kapālacūrṇa} is unusual. Ḍalhaṇa \citep[79]{vulgate} defines it as the
            powder of fragments of fresh earthen pots and Cakrapāṇidatta
            \citep[129]{acar-1939} as the powder of earthenware vessels.}
    
Next, having made the woman or man tie up the ends of their hair, eat lightly
and be firmly held by qualified attendants, the physician considers the
\seEngOnly{bandha}{joins} and then applies them by means of
\seEngOnly{chedya}{cutting}, \seEngOnly{bhedya}{splitting},
\seEngOnly{lekhya}{scarification}, or
\seEngOnly{vyadhana}{piercing}.\footnote{There are syntactic difficulties in
    this sentence.  We have %    It appears that a verb has
    %dropped out of this sentence in the Nepalese version because each word of
    % the
    %sentence is in the accusative case with no apparent verb. Therefore, we
    % have
    adopted the reading in Ḍalhaṇa's version \citep[78]{vulgate}, which has
    \dev{ca kṛtvā} following \dev{suparigṛhītaṃ}. It is likely that a verb,
    such as \dev{kṛtvā}, dropped out of the Nepalese transmission.}  Next, he
    should examine the blood of the ear to know whether it is
    \seEngOnly{duṣṭa}{tainted} or not. If it is tainted by wind, the ear
    should be bathed with \gls{dhānyāmla} and water; if tainted by choler,
    then cold water and milk should be used; if tainted by phlegm, then
    \gls{surāmaṇḍa} and water should be used, and then he should scarify it
    again.
       
After arranging the join in the ear so that it is neither proud, depressed, nor
uneven, and observing that the blood has stopped, one should anoint it with
honey and ghee, bandage each ear with \gls{picu} and 
\se{plota}{gauze}, and
bind it up with a thread, neither too tightly nor too loosely.  Then, the
physician should sprinkle earthenware powder on it and  provide
\se{ācārika}{medical advice}. And he should supplement with food as taught in  the
“Two Wound” chapter.\footnote{\emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} \Su{4.1}{396–408}.}
    
    \smallskip
\item[11]
\begin{em}
        One should avoid rubbing, sleeping during the day, exercise, overeating,
        sex, getting hot by a fire, or the effort of speaking.
    \end{em}
\smallskip

\item[12]
    
    % 17
One should not make a join when the blood is too pure, too copious, or too
thin.\footnote{1.16.17 of Ḍalhaṇa's version \citep[79]{vulgate} reads “impure”
    for the Nepalese “too pure,” which would appear to make better medical sense.
    Emending the text to \dev{nāśuddha-} for \dev{nātiśuddha-} in the Nepalese
    version would yield the same meaning as Ḍalhaṇa's version.} For when the
    ear is tainted by wind, then it is \seEngOnly{raktabaddha}{obstructed by
        blood}, unhealed and will peel. When tainted with choler, is becomes
    \se{gāḍha}{pinched}, \seEngOnly{pāka}{septic} and red.  When tainted by
    phlegm, it will be \seEngOnly{stabdha}{stiff} and itchy.  It has excessively
    copious \seEngOnly{srāva}{suppuration} and is \seEngOnly{śopha}{swollen}.  It
    has a small amount of \se{kṣīṇa}{wasted} flesh and it will not
    grow.\footnote{In his edition of \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā}, Ācārya \citep[79 n.
        1]{vulgate} includes in parentheses the following treatment for these
        conditions, which according to a footnote is not found in the palm-leaf
        manuscript he used: 'One should sprinkle it with raw sesame oil for three days
        and one should renew the cotton bandage after three days' (\dev{āmatailena
        trirātraṃ pariṣecayettrirātrācca picuṃ parivartayet}).}
    
\item[13] When the ear is properly healed and there are no complications,  one may
very gradually start to expand it.  Otherwise, it may be \se{saṃrambha}{inflamed},
burning, septic or painful.  It may even split open again.

Now, massage for the healthy ear, in order to enlarge it.
     
One should gather as much as one can the following: a \gls{godhā}, %{godhā}{Varanus

    classifications, see the analyses by \citet{zimm-1999} and \citet{smit-1994}.}
    fat, marrow, milk, and sesame oil, and white mustard oil.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa's
        version of \Su{1.16.19}{79} includes ghee. However, 
        Ḍalhaṇa's
        remarks on this passage and Cakrapāṇidatta's on 1.16.18 \citep[130]{acar-1939}
        indicate that they knew a version of this recipe, perhaps similar to the Nepalese
        one, that did not include ghee. Ḍalhaṇa also noted that others simply read four
        oils, beginning with fat and without milk, whereas Cakrapāṇidatta said that some
        say it is made with four oils and milk.}

    an \seEngOnly{udvartana}{ointment for rubbing the ear} and 
    \gls{taila} cooked
    with various medicines for massage. Cakrapāṇidatta \citep[131]{acar-1939} did not
    comment on these verses, nor verse 15 of the Nepalese version, and so the version

    edition of Ācārya \citep[80]{vulgate} has in parentheses nineteen verses
    on diseases of the ear lobes,  treatments and complications. It is
    possible that these verses were in some of the witnesses used by Ācārya to
    construct the text as they occur in other manuscripts, such as 
    \MScite{Hyderabad Osmania 137-3(b)}. However, Cakrapāṇidatta
    \citep[132]{acar-1939} and Ḍalhaṇa \citep[80]{vulgate} stated that some
    read about the diseases of the ear lobes in this chapter whereas others
    read about them in the chapter on \se{miśrakacikitsa}{various treatments}
    (SS 5.25), which does indeed begin with a discussion of the disease

    Next, having cut a \se{vadhra}{slice of flesh},\footnote{The version of
    1.16.28b known to Ḍalhaṇa \citep[81]{vulgate} reads “\se{baddham}{bound,
    connected}” instead of “\se{vadhra}{slice of flesh}.” This is a critical
    variant from the surgical point of view.  If the slice remains connected,
    it will have a continuing blood supply.  This is one of the effective
    techniques that so astonished surgeons witnessing a similar operation in
    Pune in the eighteenth century \citep[see][67--70]{wuja-2003}.} with the
    same measurements, off the cheek, the end of the nose is then
    scarified.\footnote{Or 1.16.20 could be mean, `\ldots\ off the cheek, it
        is fixed to the end of the nose, which has been scarified.' Unfortunately,
        the Sanskrit of the Nepalese version is not unambiguous on the important
        point of whether or not the flap of grafted skin remains connected to its
        original site on the cheek. However, Ḍalhaṇa \citep[81]{vulgate} clarified
        the meaning of the vulgate here by stating that one should supply the word
        “flesh” when reading “connected,” thus indicating that he understood the
        flesh to be connected to the face.} %

    \gls{eraṇḍa} plant (on \Su{1.16.21}{81}). They should not be made of lead or betel

    stretch it, and one should make its overgrown flesh

        \Su{1.16.32}{81}, which pointed out that the procedure for joining the
        nose is similar to that of joining the lips without fusing the ducts. He
        noted that earlier teachers did not think this statement on the nose and
        lips was made by sages, but he included it because it was accepted by
        Jejjaṭa, Gayadāsa and others, although they did not comment on it because
        it was easy to understand. Cakrapāṇidatta also did not comment on this
