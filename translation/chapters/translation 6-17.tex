\chapter{Uttaratantra 17: Preventing Diseases of the Pupil}
% chapter 16 in the Nepalese version.
\section{Introduction}

The therapies in this chapter make frequent use of \se{añjana}{collyrium}.  
This 
substance and its uses and variants are described in \CS\ 
\Ca{1.5.14--19}{38--39}.  In the \SS, they are included in the “group starting 
with \emph{añjana}” (\emph{añjanādigaṇa}), that is listed at 
\Su{1.38.41--42}{167}. They are described as valuable for counteracting 
\se{raktapitta}{blood-bile}, poison and \se{dāha}{overheating}.

    \item[1]  Now I shall explain the \se{pratiṣedha}{counteraction} of diseases
    located in the \se{dṛṣṭi}{pupil}.
    
    \item[2]  There are three \se{sādhya}{curable}, three \se{asādhya}{incurable},
    and six \se{yāpya}{mitigatible} diseases located in peoples eyes. Among these,
    three are \se{sādhya}{curable}. Amongst these three, %\item[3]
    the \se{pratīkāra}{remedy} has been stated for the one called
    “\se{dhūmadarśin}{seeing smoke}”.\footnote{This disease and its cure are 
    described earlier (SS.6.7.39 and SS.6.10.16 
    \citep[609 and 614]{vulgate} respectively). The latter part of this verse is
    hard to construe and the text here may have been altered at an early period.}
    
    \item[3--5ab]  When the eye is \se{vidagdha}{inflamed} by bile and when it is 
    inflamed 
    by phlegm, one should apply the method for removing bile and phlegm, using 
    \se{nasya}{nasal medicines}, 
    \se{seka}{irrigation},
    \se{añjana}{application of collyrium},\sse{añjana}{collyrium}
    \se{ālepa}{liniment}, and 
    \se{puṭapāka}{medicines cooked in a crucible},
    together with an \se{tarpaṇa}{eyewash},\footnote{These therapies are 
    described in 
    SS.6.18 
    \citep[633--640]{vulgate}.} but not 
    \se{śastrakṣata}{cutting with a blade}.\q{where is cutting with a knife related to 
        removing bile or phlegm.}\footnote{Dalhaṇa interpreted this as 
    \se{sirāvedha}{blood-letting}, which is discussed in SS.1.14 \citep[]{vulgate}.}
    
    One should drink \se{sarpis}{ghee} prepared with the
\se{triphalā}{three fruits} and in the first [case where the problem
is bile], and \se{traivṛta}{prepared with turpeth} in the latter
[case, of phlegm].
    
    And ghee with \gls{tailvaka} is wholesome in both cases, or else 
    aged ghee on its own.

    \item[5cd--7ab]
    
    In a \se{añjana}{collyrium}, these four \se{yoga}{compounds} are beneficial 
    in both cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item \gls{gairika}, \gls{saindhava}, \gls{kṛṣṇā} 
        and the \se{maṣī}{black soot} from cow's teeth;\q{maṣī burned 
        charcoal. Find 
            refs.}
        
        \item \se{gomāṃsa}{cow's flesh}, \gls{marica}, \gls{śirīṣa}
and \gls{manaḥśilā};
        
        \item 
        \se{vṛnta}{stalk} from a
        \gls{kapittha} with
        \se{madhu}{honey};\footnote{\sanengdev{kapittha}{Wood apple} in this verse is 
        ablative 
        singular or accusative plural, neither of which construe obviously.}
        
        \item
        or the the fruits of the \gls{svayaṃguptā}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item [8]
    
    The physician should make a \se{añjana}{collyrium} with ground up
\diff{\se{kupyaka}{metal}},\footnote{A metal other than gold or
    silver, according to \tvolcite{1}[217]{josi-maha} (on \dev{kupya}). 
    The Nepalese witnesses have the rare \dev{kupyaka} rather than the
    vulgate's \dev{kubjaka}, which makes no real sense.  Perhaps lead,
    which is used in making contemporary collyrium.}
 %   
    \gls{aśoka},
    \gls{śālā},
    \gls{āmra},
    \gls{priyaṅgu},
    \gls{nalina},
    \gls{utpala}, 
    together with
    \gls{hareṇu},
    \gls{āmalaka},
    \gls{pathyā},
    \gls{pippalī}.  
    It should be combined with ghee and 
    \gls{kṣaudra}.
    
    
    \item[9--10]
    
    Also, when bile and phlegm have developed, the physician should apply
    \gls{hareṇu} with the \se{svarasa}{expressed juice} of the 
    flowers
    from \gls{āmra} and \gls{jambū} trees.
    
    Then this \se{añjana}{collyrium}, \se{vipakva}{matured} with ghee and 
    \gls{kṣaudra},
    should then be applied.
    
    \item[10--11ab]
    
    \se{kiñjalka}{Filaments} of \gls{nalina} and \gls{utpala},
    with \gls{gairika}, and the juice of \se{gośakṛt}{cow-dung} are a 
    \se{añjana}{collyrium}
    in the form of a  \se{guḍikā}{pill}.  This is good for both day and night
    blindness.
    
    \item[11cd--12ab]
    
    \se{rasāñjana}{Elixir-salve}, \gls{kṣaudra}, ghee,
\gls{tālīśa}, together with gold and ochre, with the
\se{gośakṛt}{juice of cow-dung} are for an eye afflicted with bile.
    
    \item [12cd--13] 
    
    Alternatively, wise physician should first grind together \se{śīta}{elixir-salve}
    and \se{sauvīraka}{stibnite}, \se{bhāvita}{infused} with \se{rasa}{the
        blood of birds and animals}.\footnote{This was Ḍalhaṇa's preferred interpretation
    of \emph{rasa} “juice” in this context.  He also noted that some take
    \se{śīta}{elixir-salve} to be camphor.}  Then he mixes it with the bile of a
    tortoise or with \se{rauhita}{extract of rohu carp}.  It should always be used
    with powdered \se{añjana}{collyrium} to quell the bile.
    
    \item[14]
    
    Thus, a \se{añjana}{collyrium} of \gls{kārśmarī} flowers, 
    \gls{madhuka},
    \gls{dārvī}, \gls{lodhra} and \se{rasāñjana}{elixir salve}
    is always good as a collyrium in this case.
    
    
    \item [15]
    
    Alternatively, for those who cannot see during the day, this \se{guḍikā}{pill},
    with sandalwood, is recommended: \se{nadīja}{salt}, conch shell and the three
    spices, \se{añjana}{collyrium}, \se{manaḥśilā}{realgar}, the two
    \se{rajana}{turmerics}\footnote{Turmeric (Curcuma longa \textit{Linn.}) and tree
    turmeric (Berberis aristata DC).  The term \emph{rajana} is unusual; the normal
    term is \emph{rajanī}. \emph{Rajana} occurs in \emph{Suśrutanighaṇṭu} 158 in the
    sense of Ferula asafoetida, Linn.} and \se{yakṛdrasa}{liver
        extract}.\footnote{This verse appears as no.\,27 in the vulgate.}
    
    \item [16] One should grind up \se{srotoja}{kohl},\footnote{Glossed by Ḍalhaṇa as
    a kind of \se{añjana}{collyrium}.\label{srotas-kohl}  Cf.\ 
    \cite[2.M13]{nadk-1954} and 
    \cite[197--198]{shar-1982}}
    and \gls{saindhav} and long pepper and also 
    \se{hareṇu}{hareṇu}.  
    Such wicks with goats urine are good in a \se{añjana}{collyrium} for
    \se{kṣaṇadāndhya}{night blindness}.
    
    \item [17--18ab] Alternatively, in such a case, grind together
    \se{kālānusāriva}{Indian sarsaparilla}\footnote{There are two forms of
    \emph{sārivā} mentioned widely in Āyurvedic literature, the white and the black.
    Ideas on the identity of the black form are particularly fluid.  See
    \citet[434--438]{adps} for a clear discussion.} long pepper, \se{nāgara}{dried
        ginger} and honey, the leaf of the \se{tālīśapatra}{scramberry}, the two
    \se{rajana}{turmerics}, a conch shell and \se{yakṛdrasa}{liver extract}. %
    Then shade-dried wicks take away \se{ruj}{illness}.
    
    
    \item[18cd--19ab]
    
    Wicks made of \se{manaḥśilā}{red arsenic},
    \se{abhayā}{chebulic myrobalan},
    \se{vyoṣa}{the three spices}.
    \se{sāriva}{Indian sarsaparilla}, 
    \se{samudraphena}{cuttlefish bone}, 
    combined with goat's milk are good.
    
    \item[19cd--21ab]
    
    One should cook a \se{kṣaudrāñjana}{honey collyrium} 
    \sse{añjana}{collyrium}either in the juices of
    \se{gomūtra}{cow's urine}, and bile, \se{madirā}{spirits}, \se{yakṛt}{liver}, and
    \se{dhātrī}{emblic} or else in the juice of the \se{yakṛt}{liver} of something
    different, or else with the extract of the \se{triphalā}{three fruits}. %
    One of these should be mixed with cow urine, ghee and \se{arṇavamala}{cuttle
        fish}\footnote{At SS 6.12.31, Ḍalhaṇa glossed \emph{arṇavamala} as
    \se{samudraphena}{cuttlefish bone}. It may be worth considering whether the
    unusual term \emph{arṇavamala} “ocean-filth” might refer to ambergris.} with long
    pepper, honey and \se{kaṭphala}{box myrtle}. It is placed in sea salt and stored
    in a bamboo tube.
    
    \item[21cd--22]
    
    One should cook the liver of a sheep, the ghee of a goat, with long pepper and Sindh 
    salt, honey and the juice of emblics.  Then one should store it properly in a catechu 
    box.  Prepared thus, the honey \se{añjana}{collyrium} is good. 
    
    
    \item[23]
    
    Alternatively, a \se{añjana}{collyrium} that is \se{hareṇu}{hareṇu} mixed 
    with
\se{māgadhī}{long pepper}, the bone and the marrow of a goat,
\se{elā}{cardamom} and liver, together with liver extract, is good for eyes
afflicted by phlegm.\footnote{On the identities of \emph{elā} and
\emph{hareṇu}, \citet[511\,ff]{watt-comm} described the former as “true” or
“lesser” or “Malabar” cardamom, \emph{Elettaria cardamomum}, Maton \& White. 
In contrast, the “greater” cardamom is \textit{Amomum subulatum} (that Watt
discussed on p.\,65) that is commonly used as an inferior substitute for \textit{E.
cardamomum}. \citet[467\,f]{gvdb} provided an interesting discussion of
\emph{hareṇu}, noting that the term refers to two substances, first the
\emph{satīna} pulse (\emph{Pisum sativum}, Linn.), and second an unknown fruit such
as perhaps a \emph{Vitex}. They noted, “None of the text commentators have attempted
to disclose the nature of its source plant,” although Ḍalhaṇa described it as
aromatic and identical to \emph{reṇukā} (SS.ci.2.75).%
% Sanskrit: {hareṇu}, Latin: {Amomum subulatum, Roxb.?}, References: {PVS
%Caraka 2.734, AVS 1.128, NK #154} %
}
    
    \item[24] 
    
    Over a fire, one should cook the \se{yakṛt}{liver} of a \se{godhā}{monitor lizard} 
    prepared
    with \se{antra}{entrails} and stuffed with \se{māgadhi}{long pepper}.  As is well 
    known, \se{yakṛt}{liver} which is \se{niṣevita}{used} with 
    \se{añjana}{collyrium} certainly 
    destroys night blindness.
    
    
    \item [25] 
    
    After preparing both a \se{plīhan}{spleen} and a liver on a spit, one should eat them
    both with ghee and oil.\footnote{We read the locative as if an instrumental; if the
    locative were intended then it would be the spit that would be coated with oil and
    ghee.}
    
    \item [25cd--26ab]
    
    As is well known, there are  six diseases that can be \se{yāpya}{alleviated};
    \se{tatra}{in those cases} one should release the blood by bloodletting.
    
    And for the sake of wellbeing one should also purge using aged ghee 
    \se{upahita}{combined} with 
    purgative \se{aṅga}{aids}. 
    
    \item[26cd--27]
    
    When an eye-disease is \se{pavanodbhava}{caused by wind} they say that
    \se{pañcāṅgulataila}{castor oil} mixed with milk is good.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa said
    that the unexpressed topic of this recipe is \se{timira}{partial blindness}.} In
    the case of diseases of \se{śonita}{blood} and \se{pitta}{bile}, one should drink
    ghee with the three fruits; it is particularly
    cleansing.\footnote{\se{śonita-pitta, rakta-pitta}{Blood-bile} is a
    widely-recognized disease in ayurveda, but the compound here is definitely dual,
    which rules out that interpretation. One would expect blood-bile because the
    previous verse } In the case of phlegm, a purgative by means of
    \se{trivṛt}{turpeth} is recommended. In the case of all three humours,
    \se{sugandhi}{sandal} in oil is prepared with it (turpeth).\footnote{The expression 
    “\se{tailasugandhi}{the fragrant one in oil}” is puzzling. The word \emph{sugandhi} 
    has different referents in the \emph{Nighaṇṭu} literature but is not common as a 
    noun in the extant literature. “Sandal” is just one of its possible meanings.}
    % Ḍalhaṇa (commentary on SS.ci.24.7) equates  
    %\emph{trivarga}, i.e., \emph{triphalā}, with \emph{trisugandhi}.
    
    \item[28]
    
    In cases of \se{timira}{partial blindness}, aged ghee is recommended.  It is good if 
    it is kept in an iron vessel.
    
    \item [28cd--29ab]
    
    One should know that ghee with the three mylobalans is always good, and it is made
    with what is called \se{meṣaviṣāṇa}{periploca of the woods}.
    
    A man who is suffering from partial blindess should lick the finely-ground three fruits 
    mixed with ghee \se{sapāṇa}{off his hand}.\footnote{“Off his hand” translates the 
    adverbial \emph{sapāṇam}, an unusual word. Ḍalhaṇa reproduced a reading close 
    to the Nepalese recension but says that Jejjaṭa rejects it and so he also does 
    \citep[627]{vulgate}.}
    
    \item[29cd]
    
    Alternatively, someone afflicted by phlegm should apply them (the three fruits)
    mixed with oil and \se{pragāḍha}{steeped} in honey.
    
    \item[30]
    
    The very best oil, well-cooked with a decoction of cow-dung, is good in cases of 
    partial blindness, taken as an errhine.
    
    In cases caused by bile, ghee by itself is good, as is oil when it arises from wind and 
    blood.
    
    \item[31]
    And in the case of wind one should apply
    \se{trivṛt}{turpeth} based on
    \se{atibalā}{strong mallow},
    and \se{balā}{country mallow}
    in an \se{nasya}{errhine}.\footnote{“Based on” translates \emph{-āśrita} 
    “depending on” which does not construe easily here.  The vulgate has \emph{śṛta} 
    “cooked” which makes easier sense but is not supported by the Nepalese MSS.}
    
    Ghee which has been extracted from milk cooked with the meat of aquatic 
    creatures and those from marshlands should be prescribed.
    
    \item[32]
    
    \dag An \se{puṭākhya}{enclosed roasting} with  Sindh salt and the product of the
    meat of a \se{kravyabhuj}{carnivore} and a \se{eṇa}{deer}, is combined with 
    honey
    and ghee.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa noted \citep[628a]{vulgate} that \emph{puṭāhvaya} 
    (see
    verse 35 below) is a synonym for \emph{puṭapāka}, and that the process is
    described in the \emph{Kriyākalpa} chapter, i.e., SS.6.18.33--38
    \citep[635]{vulgate}.  On the \emph{puṭa} process in the 
    \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā},
    which is earlier and different than that of \emph{rasaśāstra} literature, see the
    discussion by  \citet[83]{wujad-2019}:
    \begin{quote}
        The term ‘enclosed roasting’ (\emph{puṭapāka}) does occur in
        the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} in the context of eye treatments, but
        designates a method of obtaining juice from substances by
        wrapping them in leaves pasted with earth and cooking
        the bolus on charcoal to finally extract a juice.
    \end{quote}
    } % end of footnote
    
    \se{vasā}{Fat} from a horse, a vulture, a snake, and a \se{tāmracūḍa}{cock},
    combined with \gls{madhūka} is always good in a 
    \se{añjana}{collyrium}.\dag\footnote{This
    verse contain irresolvable difficulties. There are no significant variants in the
    Nepalese MS transmission, but the text is ungrammatical.   The vulgate reads
    substantially differently but we have nevertheless made some emendations in line
    with it and read the verse as two sentences.}
    
    \item [33]
    
    Having \se{niṣevita}{prepared} a \se{añjana}{collyrium} made of
\se{srotas}{kohl}, gradually combine it with \se{rasa}{juices},
milk and ghee.\footnote{On \dev{srotas} “kohl” see footnote
    \ref{srotas-kohl}.  \Dalhana{6.17.36ab}{628} explicitly specified
    that the juices are meat soups of various animals that are
    “pleasing to the eye” (\dev{cakṣuṣyamṛgapakṣimāṃsarasaḥ}).}
    
    For thirty days, this \se{añjana}{collyrium} is put in the mouth
of a black snake that is covered with \se{kuśa}{kuśa grass}.
    
    \item [34]
    
    Next, a \se{añjana}{collyrium} that is milk containing \se {māgadhī}{long 
    pepper},
    \se{kṣāraka}{lye} and \gls{saindhav} that has been repeatedly 
    prepared
    with the mouth of a black snake, is good in the case of \se{rāgin
        timira}{bloodshot blindness}.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa described this blindness as a type
    of \emph{kāca} disease caused by wind  \citep[628]{vulgate}. The expression
    “bloodshot blindness” is an attempt to capture the idea of a blind eye that is
    dyed or coloured (not colour-blindness). This verse is quite different from the
    vulgate and also syntactically challenging.}
    
    \item [35]
    
    They say that ghee may be produced from that and combined with sweet herbs is 
    good as an errhine for eye-diseases caused by bile.
    
    And here, an \se{tarpaṇa}{eyewash} is good that is a combination that is the flesh of
    wild animals \se{puṭāhvaya}{taken hot}.\footnote{The expression
    \se{puṭāhvaya}{taken hot} is a guess.  }
    
    
    \item[36]
    
    And 
    \se{manaḥśilā}{realgar} mixed with 
    \se{rasāñjana}{elixir salve} and honey is a 
    \se{dravāñjana}{liquid collyrium} \sse{añjana}{collyrium}which is, in this 
    case, combined with 
    \gls{madhūka}.\footnote{The expression \se{dravāñjana}{liquid collyrium} 
    is
    only known from Ḍalhaṇa's comments on \Su{6.17.11ab}{626}.  The
    recipe in the present collyrium is different from that discussed by Ḍalhaṇa.}
    
    Alternatively, experts on this say that finely ground \se{tuttha}{blue
    vitriol} extracted from a gold mine is the “\se{samāñjana}{same
    collyrium}”\sse{añjana}{collyrium}.\footnote{On \emph{tuttha}, which may 
    also be identified with zinc
oxide or as crushed sea-urchin shells, see \citet[112\,ff.]{falk-1991}; zinc
oxide is a component of skin-balms but is not recommended for application in
the eyes themselves.  The expression “\se{samāñjana}{same collyrium}” is a
hapax legomenon glossed inexplicably by Ḍalhaṇa as “a collyrium with an equal
amount of fermented barley” (\emph{tulyasauvīrāñjana}) \citep[628]{vulgate}.}
    
    \item [37]
    
    Conch mixed with equal parts of sheep's horn and \se{añjana}{stibnite} removes the
    impurity of the \se{kāca}{glassy opacity} because of the \se{añjana}{application
        of collyrium}\sse{añjana}{collyrium}.\footnote{The ablative “from 
        collyrium” is hard to construe, but 
    Ḍalhaṇa used this term and phrase in his commentary on \Su{6.17.41ab}{629}.}
    
    
    
    The \se{rasa}{extracts} produced from 
    a\se{palāśa}{flame of the forest},
    \se{rohīta}{Rohīta tree},\footnote{Probably \emph{Soymida febrifuga} A. Juss.}
    \gls{madhūka},
    ground with the \se{agra}{supernatant layer} of the \se{madira}{spirits} is 
    applied. 
    
    \item[38]
    
    Alternatively, one should cook an errhine with 
    \se{uśīra}{cuscus grass},
    \se{lodhra}{lodh tree},
    \se{triphalā}{the three fruits},
    \se{priyaṅgu}{beauty berry} to pacify eye diseases caused by 
    phlegm.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa invoked a \se{paribhāṣā}{general rule} to indicate that 
    this mixture should be cooked with sesame oil. }
    
    
    
    One should apply smoke of the bark of
    \se{vidaṅga}{embelia},
    \se{pāthā}{velvet leaf},
    \se{kinihī}{white siris},
    and
    \se{iṅgudī}{desert date}; and
    \se{uśīra}{cuscus grass} alone.
    
    \item[39]

    When there is \se{rāgiṇi timire}{bloodshot blindness}, the wise physician should

    says \se{kṛcchra}{with difficulty}, the
implication is that it is \se{asādhya}{untreatable} (cf.\ \Su{6.17.2}{625}

standard categories of triage.}

    \item [50] Or it may be uneven, thin in the middle, streaked or have excessive
    \se{prabha}{shine}. A \se{doṣa}{humour} in the pupil may be characterized as being
    painful or having blood.\footnote{In the vulgate, and in parallel passages in the
    AS, the reading “\se{bhavet}{it may be}” is replaced with the negative “\se{na
    ced}{if, then not}” (cf.\ \As{utt.17.1--3}{712}).   These characteristics are then
    read as conditions that preclude surgery;  for the Nepalese recension, they are
    simply descriptions of the appearance of a cataract.}

    At a time that is neither too hot or too cold, 
    the patient who has been oiled and sweated
    is restrained and seated, looking symmetrically at his own nose.
    
    The wise physician should \se{muktvā}{separate} two white sections from the
    \se{kṛṣṇa}{black part} and from the \se{apāṅga}{outer corner of the eye}. 
    Then he should 
    \se{pīḍ-}{press} properly into the eye,\footnote{We

    locative \emph{nayane} as the place of pressing; other interpreters take it as an

    hand with the middle finger, forefinger and thumb,
    the left one with the right hand and the other one contrariwise.
    
    When the piercing is done properly, there is the issue of a drop of liquid and
a sound.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa  remarked on \Su{6.17.61ab}{630} that when the
piercing is not correctly done, blood issues and there is no sound.} %

    Without injuring, gently pushing the phlegm in the circuit of the pupil against the nose, he 
    should remove it by means of \se{ucchiṅgana}{sniffing}.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa described

    Whether the humour is \se{styāna}{solid} or \se{cala}{liquid}, one should apply
    sweating to the eye externally, with \se{bhaṅga}{leaves} that remove wind, after
    fixing the \se{sūcī}{needle} properly.\footnote{We interpret \emph{bhaṅga} as
    leaves, following the usage elsewhere in this sthāna \Su{4.32.9, 6.11.5}{513, 614}
    where \emph{bhaṅga} means \se{pallava}{shoots}. A similar procedure is
    described at \As{6.17.25}{716a}, where sweating of the eye is done by means 
    of the
    leaves of a castor-oil plant.}

    “\se{agramukta}{free from the point}” to “\se{abhramukta}{free from clouds}”.  The

    Having smeared ghee on the eye, one should cover it with a bandage.  Then, he must lie

    \item[61]
    At that time, he should not belch, cough, sneeze, spit or shiver.  Afterwards there should be 
    \se{yantraṇā}{restrictions} as in the case of someone who has drunk 
    oil.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa glossed “\se{yantraṇā}{restrictions}” as having a controlled diet 
    and 
    the other restrictions appropriate to someone who is taking oil as a preparation before 
    further 
    therapy (\Su{6.17.68}{631}). These restrictions are also described at \Su{6.18.28}{635} 
    and   \Ah{1.16.25cd}{249}.}

    Every three days one should wash it with

    After three days, one should sweat the eye externally because of the danger of wind. 
    
    \item[63]
    Having restrained himself in this way for ten days he should thereafter take a beneficial
