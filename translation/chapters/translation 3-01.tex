\chapter{Śārīrasthāna 1:  A Consideration of All Beings}

\section{Introduction}


The short account of Sāṅkhya philosophy offered in this chapter of the
\SS\ is several times characterized by its authors as being ``special to
physicians".\footnote{3.1.11 \dev{vaidyake tu} ``but in
    medicine\ldots''; 3.1.13 \dev{cikitsite} ``in medicine''; 3.1.16
    \dev{āyurvedaśāstreṣu} ``in the treatises about medicine\ldots '';
    3.1.16 \dev{sa eṣa karmapuruṣaścikitsādhikṛtaḥ} ``it is this agentic
    person that medicine is concerned with.''}  And it does indeed stand
    slightly apart from the major classical forms of Sāṅkhya philosophy in
    some regards.

For example, the description of the evolution from Ahaṅkāra given in  \SS\
3.1.4 (p.\,\pageref{3.1.4}) corresponds more to the
\textit{Māṭharavṛtti} and to the Purāṇas than to other
commentaries on the \emph{Sāṅkhyakārikā}.  As \citeauthor{solo-1974}
pointed out, the description of Ahaṅkāra in Māṭhara's commentary on the
\emph{Sāṅkhyakārikā} (ca.\,1000) is unique in the following regard:
\begin{quote}
    All [early Sāṅkhya commentaries]
    mention the paryāyas of ahaṃkāra, viz.\ bhūtādi, vaikṛta
    and taijasa; but all except M[āṭharavṛtti] simply state that the 16
    are produced from ahaṃkāra and enumerate them. M[āṭharavṛtti] 
    alone explains here that the five tanmātras are produced
    from bhūtādi which is tāmasa, the 11 organs are
    produced from vaikṛta which is sāttvika, while both
    are produced from taijasa which is rājasa.\footcite[52, 180]{solo-1974}     
\end{quote}
 This historically distinct scheme, as also presented in the Purāṇas,
was shown in a clear diagram by \citet[27]{biar-1981}; see
Figure~\ref{fig:biardeau1981-p27}.

Another example of the \SS's eclectic account of Sāṅkhya is the list
of homologies given in 3.1.7--8.  The evolutes of Prakṛti are
described as having three aspects or instantiations:  in the
individual person (\emph{adhyātma}), in the physical world
(\emph{adhibhūta}), and in the divine realm (\emph{adhideva}).  While
this terminology is reminiscent of very old language from the
Upaniṣads, this specific scheme is not widely known in Sāṅkhya
literature, or anywhere.\footnote{These homologies in the \SS\ were
    noted by \citet[55]{comb-2011}. For the Upaniṣads, one thinks of
    \emph{Bṛhadāraṇyaka} 1.5.21 (\emph{adhyātma}), 3.7.15
    (\emph{adhibhūta, adhyātma}), 2.3.3 (\emph{adhidaivata}), \emph{et
    passim}.} The scheme is first found in the \emph{Mahābhārata}: see
    Table~\ref{MbhHomologies}.\footnote{Referred to in \emph{Mahābhārata}
        6.30.1 \pvolcite{7}[1666--1668]{sukt-1933} and then described in
        detail twice, in 12.300.17--301.14 (\emph{ibid}.\ 15, 1666--1668) and
        in 14.42.27–4 (\emph{ibid}.\ 18, 152--153).}
%
The scheme also appears in the fourteenth- or fifteenth-century
\emph{Tattvasamāsasūtra} sūtras 7--9 and in its commentaries
\emph{Kramadīpikā} and the \emph{Tattvayāthārthyadīpanaṭīkā} of
Bhāvagaṇeśa, both of  which set out homologous triples, equating
ontologies on the personal, physical and divine 
levels.\footnote{\cite[81--82]{dviv-1996}
    and \cite[15--16]{bhat-1965} respectively.  On the dates of the works,
    see \cites[152--153]{huli-1978}[ch.\,24 et passim]{lars-1987}.}

\section{Literature} 

Meulenbeld offered an annotated overview of this chapter and a
bibliography of earlier scholarship to 2002 and, in his notes,
citations of the parallel passages in the
\CS.\fvolcite{IA}[243]{meul-hist}  \citet{lars-1987} provided a major
overview of Sāṅkhya literature. Recent overviews of the classical
Sāṅkhya theory include those of
\textcites[\S2.4]{chat-2021}[ch.\,22]{adam-2022}{ruzs-2025}.
\citet[54--56]{comb-2011} studied the Sāṅkhya concepts specifically in
the \SS.

    \item [1] 
    
    So, now we shall explain anatomy chapter that is a reflection about all 
    beings.\footnote{The Nepalese version has nouns in apposition 
    (“-\dev{cintā} $\leftrightarrow$ \dev{śārīram}”).  The vulgate makes this a 
    single 
    karmadhāraya compound that is slightly easier to parse.} 
    
\item[3]

%The cause of all beings, called “the unmanifest,” is without a cause,
%is characterised by sattva, rajas and tamas,  has eight forms and
%is the reason for the appearance  of this whole world.

That which is called “the unmanifest” is the causeless cause of all living beings,  
having the characteristics of sattva, rajas and tamas, having eight forms, and 
being the reason for the appearance of this whole world.
    
It is the single basis of the many \se{kṣetrajña}{knowers of the
    field}, just as the ocean is to the beings who live in
water.\footnote{The Nepalese witnesses differ from the vulgate here,
    reading \dev{udakaujas} “creatures whose power is water.”  This is
    linguistically and semantically implausible. Ḍalhaṇa remarked that
    there were different interpretations of this simile in the vulgate
    version, \dev{audakānām} “creatures having watery character." Some
    thought it meant ``like rivers, lakes and other forms of water are
    supported by the ocean", while other thought it referred to living
    beings like fish and plants that are supported by the ocean." The
    emendation to \dev{udakaukas} suggested by Philipp Maas is compelling
    semantically and palaeographically.}
    
\item[3.1.4]
\label{3.1.4}

From that unmanifest, the Mahat arises, having exactly the same
properties.\footnote{In classical Sāṅkhya theory, \dev{mahat} is a
    synonym for \dev{buddhi}, ``intellect.''  In the present passage, this
    identity is not explicit; rather, it is a cosmological entity.  In the
    cosmology of the \emph{Pātañjalayogaśāstra}, it is pure being,
    \dev{sattāmātra} 2.19 \citep[85]{agas-1904}, it is also sometimes
    designated as the great \dev{ātman} ``great self'' in the sense of a
    universal being.} %
    From that Mahat, which has those same properties, arises the
    Ahaṅkāra, having exactly the same characteristics.\footnote{The
        Ahaṅkāra, etymologically ``the utterance `I',''  is the assertion
        of personal and creative identity. See the classic study by
        \citet{buit-1957} that discusses the several problems raised by the
        term.}  It has three aspects: \se{vaikārika}{mutable},
        \se{taijasa}{fiery} and
        \se{bhūtādi}{elemental}.\footnote{\label{puraniccosmology}These
            technical terms occur in \emph{Sāṅkhyakārikā} 22 as synonyms for
            Ahaṅkāra.  In \emph{Sāṅkhykārikā} 25, they are described as
            emanations coming from Ahaṅkāra \parencites[46--47,
            50]{sast-1948}[187--188, 195--196]{wezl-1998}. They also occur in
            the Purāṇic cosmogonies; \citet[27]{biar-1981} offered a useful
            diagrammatic representation of these showing these relationships,
            reproduced in Figure~\ref{fig:biardeau1981-p27}.  See the
            discussion of these difficult terms by \citet[23--25]{buit-1957}.}

            
            From that mutable Ahaṅkāra the 
            eleven \se{indriya}{faculties} arise, with the very same
            characteristics. It is as follows: ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose,
            speech, hand, genitals, anus, feet and mind.  Amongst these, the first 
            five are the faculties of \se{buddhi}{cognition}; the next five are the 
            faculties of \se{karma}{action}.  The mind has properties of both.
            
            From the Ahaṅkāra as \se{bhūtādi}{starting point for the
    elements}, arise the five \se{tanmātra}{bare entities},
with exactly the same characteristics.\footnote{Earlier,
    the Ahaṅkāra was said to have three aspects, so we would
    here expect a description of the \se{taijasa}{fiery}
    aspect.  But the Nepalese version goes straight to the
    \se{bhūtādi}{elemental} aspect.  The vulgate text inserts
    the fiery aspect alongside the elemental as if it were
    similar in all respects (\dev{taijasasahāya}).}  It is as
    follows: bare sound, bare touch, bare form, bare taste,
    bare smell.\footnote{Or, ``the essence of sound,'' etc.}
    
    From these \se{bhūta}{elements} come space, air, fire, water and earth; 
    from these come sound, touch, form, taste and smell, with the same 
    distinctions.  In this way these twenty-four \sepl{tattva}{principle} have 
    been explained. 
            
\item[5]    

In this context, sound and so on are the objects of the \se{indriya}{faculties} of 
cognition.  Amongst the faculties of action, they are: speaking, holding, 
enjoyment, excretion and walking respectively.  

\item[6]

The eight \sepl{prakṛti}{productive principle} are 
the \se{avyakta}{unmanifest},
\se{mahān}{The Great}, 
the \se{ahaṅkāra}{I-principle}, 
and the five \se{tanmātra}{fine elements}.
The rest are the sixteen \se{vikāra}{modifications}.
    
\item[7]   

And for each of these, the sense object is the 
\se{adhibhūta}{physical}.\footnote{There is a question about what
    ``of them'' refers to.  The list that follows has thirteen terms;
    fifteen if one takes hands and feet as duals; seventeen if one takes
    eyes and ears as pairs.  This does not quite correspond to any of the
    previous listings.   The following list only lists the divine and personal
    ontologies; the physical ones are not explicitly listed.
    
    The Nepalese version before emendation had a different meaning at
this point (ignoring grammatical difficulties): "Each and every
one of them has a sovereign with respect to their domain." See the edition's
critical apparatus for details.}  But their own 
\se{adhyātma}{personal aspect} is the
\se{adhideva}{divine aspect}, thus,\\

\item[3.1.8]

This whole group lacks consciousness.\footnote{I.e., the group of
    twenty-four \sepl{tattva}{principle}.}  And the twenty-fifth, the
    Person (\emph{puruṣa})\sse{puruṣa}{person}, is the one that causes
    consciousness.  And he is connected to the  \se{kārya}{effects} that
    are the \sepl{karaṇa}{instrument}.\footnote{The vulgate text at this
        point has, ``is united by  \se{kāraṇa}{cause} and result,'' a quite
        different and easier reading.  In philosophical prose one would
        hesitate to interpret \se{karaṇa}{instrument} as 
        \se{kāraṇa}{cause} As
        a dvandva, \dev{karaṇakārya}  breaks Pāṇini 2.2.34 because
        \dev{karaṇa} has more vowels than \dev{kārya}. Reading the 
        compound
        \dev{karaṇakārya} not as a dvandva, but as a karmadhārya seems 
        preferable.}
        %
        Even though the \se{pradhāna}{productive principle} is
        unconscious, they point out that it is active for the purpose
        of the Person's \se{kaivalya}{freedom}.\footnote{The
            expression ``they point out" suggests reference to outside
            experts.  Since the following milk simile is identical to
            \emph{Sāṅkhyakārikā} 57
            \parencites[184--186]{main-1972}[263]{wezl-1998}, it seems
            certain that the reference is to this text or a lost
            predecessor.  The \emph{Sāṅkhyakārikā} was translated into
            Chinese in the mid-sixth century and may have been composed
            one or two centuries before that time \citep[138]{huli-1978}.}
            %
            On this point, they give the examples of causes like the
            one about milk, etc.\footnote{I.e., the calf  in the
                proximity of the cow causes the milk, in the same way that
                Prakṛti in the proximity of Puruṣa causes evolution.
                \Dalhana{3.1.8}{340} explained that the milk, even though
                it is \se{ajña}{unconscious}, \se{pravartate}{comes forth}
                (in the cow) for the purpose of nourishing a calf. Ḍalhaṇa
                also gave the example of a man's semen that is
                \se{ajña}{incognizant} but is \se{pravartate}{comes forth}
                in the presence of erotic women, at a private party, for
                the purpose of the man's enjoyment.
                \emph{Pātañjalayogaśāstra} 4.17 addressed the same issue
                with the simile of magnetism: the \se{citta}{mind} was
                likened to a piece of iron that is attracted by the magnet
                of sense objects \citep[193]{agas-1904}.}
